I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some

I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing,
we're just one big family.
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on, scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me
ah, la one big family ([2nd time:] ah, la happy family)
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love love love

I won't hesitate no more
Oh no more no more no more
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved, I'm sure

I looked at her and she looked at me
And i turned on those kc lights and drove all night
'cause it felt so right, her and i, man we felt so right.

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart

I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see

I shall drink in and always be full
My cup shall always be full

In they color, put you on another

Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could make you mine

I'll run to meet you

Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
Staring back at me

Baby, you're the inspiration for this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life

Knows everybody's disapproval

She is the last true mouthpiece

A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
you heard them say it

She tells me ""worship in the bedroom""

Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Something meaty for the main course

That looks plenty

There is no sweeter innocence
Than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo, need some fries with that shake
See many terms they use to relate
I love the girls with the big old booties
Right up front they call em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hanging from the jeans
Even city girls can be country things

And check out the way they step
Make a brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
And they're tan to the top all the way
But it don't matter what kinda legs you like
Still be kicking if those legs are lily white
So it makes no difference to you

Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I got the bank roll

That I might not last the day

You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out

And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low ho

If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid

Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

And let it shine
Just own the night

You're original, cannot be replaced

So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know

I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soul mates
Talk to me girl

[Bridge (Keri Hilson):]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (Timbaland)]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl

[Verse 3: D.O.E.]
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat but I can float your boat

Alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack, get up
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy

Yup, bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four track, busing halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat crushin', labels out here

Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give that to the people
Spread it across the country, labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me
I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

(Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye
I've got a world to see;
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

So much he can say 
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain 
To me, you're like a growing 
Addiction that I can't deny 
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby? 
But did you know that when it snows 
My eyes become larger 
And the light that you shine can be seen? 

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels yeah

She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day

Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la

Be that girl for a month
But the worst's yet to come

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn

""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

I'm taking a mental picture of you now

The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Oh this has gotta be the good life

This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now

Hope there's a conversation
That we both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize...

If you asked me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I'll go out and I'll sit down
At a table was set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it to hell
But still you're magnificent

I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back at the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not, even close, without you

If you asked me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

You know that isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

Have dried the tears from my eyes

That it keeps them in the pouring rain

What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain

And name this day in time
For falling prey to crime

Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me

I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

(Rihanna)
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

(Rihanna)

I had one question for you

Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
Cuz you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find so
Tell me if you want me to

If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy you're wrong cuz all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is an opportunity that I can't miss no, no
Boy you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm sayin' are for real
Cuz you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby
I got to know how you feel

Sweetheart
Now it's time I let you know
I don't wanna rush
We shoud take it slow

Can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning
I'll give you a happy ending

You<U+2019>ll be there when the money comes
You know it's leather when we ride
We're flinging rawhide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns

Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey<U+2019>s head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin<U+2019> out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must<U+2019>ve done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it<U+2019>s too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life<U+2019>s better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn<U+2019>t let me in

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we<U+2019>d know
We said someday we<U+2019>d find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She<U+2019>s had a couple of kids since then
I haven<U+2019>t seen her since God knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh god I, I

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Secrets (secrets) hurt someone
Let me tell you how it all began
A little secret got out of hand

I ran into him just by chance
At this party we were talking then we started to dance
The music banging' then he leaned in close
My mind is telling' me that I should go (but I stayed)

In a moment of weakness (a mistake)
But I kept it a secret
Soon enough I found
Secrets have a way of getting out

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise if you'll just come back to me I swear no secrets, no deceit
I'll be your angel oh so sweet no secrets will I keep

Every night I light a candle
Every morning well I say a little prayer
In hopes that when I open my eyes
I will find you standing there

I confess a crime against our love
My loneliness is punishment enough
Forgiveness is Devine
Everyone keeps secrets sometimes

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Angels in heaven above
I know I've sinned against love
Grant me this one miracle
And I'll be a saint from now on

Look in my eyes and it's that that you see it
It's been two weeks since my confession
And still he's not back in my arms
My love for you is the truth cause my heart keeps no secrets
Heaven just give me a sign; tell me his heart is still mine

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

CHORUS:
Although we've come to the End Of The Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the End of the Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

REPEAT CHORUS.

(spoken)
Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
Coz you just won't come back to me
Will you? Just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts baby
(Lonely)
I feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

If you told me to die for you I would

There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Using symbols, using words
Can be likened
To a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Don't try to change it now, see you got to bounce

It's so hard to believe that you are home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you got to lie 
I'm caught in your game, when you cannot say my name

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things 
(Somethings goin' down, that's the way it seems) 
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange

And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown never

Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I've longed for you, my love forever

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy ( I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder
'Cause in the Dirty we dem boys that drank you under the table
Where dem niggaz pimp hoes in fly suits and gators
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call
Just dial 1-800-430 slash ALCOHOL
And dawg I'm not the one that you really just wanna clown
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut 'em down
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool
In the cut 'bout slizzard somewhere that's how we do

Out of town hard heads get swiss cheesed up
And you gon' need more than stitches to patch that leak up
Chump like me up my mouth TB'd up
With the plush leather guts steady grippin' the butt
Oh you fo sho with it, then pull yo pistol
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it
Talkin' big boy shit
Me muggin' like a motherfucker my hand on my dick

'Cause at a grip we keep it jumpin' like it ain't nuttin' new
We started off with Shake Em Off so look potna oh guess who
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85
And hit you with that U-Way so don't be surprised
We buckin' blowin' chillin' and sippin' on something good
I'm peepin' out the scenery and wishin' a nigga would
In case it just might pop I'm 'bout ready to lock and load

Rain, rain, go away, that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates
No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'ma get money, nigga, everyday stunting, nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me
Bitch, I'm balling like I'm coming off of free throws
Just ahead of the game, no cheat codes
Lambo, Roscoe, no street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, go, go on and do your dance
And I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance
DJ, turn me up
Ladies, this your jam
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands
Girl, drop it to the floor, I love the way your booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move and I'll proceed to throw this cash",32,266

The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

I spend her love
Until she's broke inside

Written on these walls
Are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage

I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Althought I am broken
My heart is untamed, still

Where a wild-eyed mystic prophet on a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think muhfuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission
And the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, Money Ain't a Thing, nigga
We still the same niggas, flows just changed
Now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal

Hey girl, I can see your body moving 
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby, asi es perfecto

Oh I know I am on tonight, my hips don't lie

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self restraint 
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me
Back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for humpty humpty
I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
No more do we snatch ropes 
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

Soul is in danger

Sorry but I have to move on

It's not about taking sides

It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Untie the weight tags I never thought I could

Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again

It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Where have the times gone

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights

While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, you better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my Mom and my Pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill

In the back, sippin purple chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us, forty
Gripin panties, sippin, and the seats are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, k.o.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellows
Oh what the hell, i guess i better tell ya
It's friday night, i got a brand new kick on
For me to get bent on
Hit the country of the picked up ml
Eighty west, back to the hotel
At the tele, bones is doing butt work
Johnny ziti had his hand up her miniskirt
The late in the corner started to flirt
And i knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so i took her to my ride
Grab my mickey's and my boda and i met her outside
Who-ride, i'd like to do this honey to the triple gold z's
Acid in my bottle, so i gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what i mean when i'm feelin kinda funky
A sick honky, straight going donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in my glove
Layin in the livin, cause i'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the tele, i gotta get some new cock
Ah naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so i called tl
Smooth me up, sally wanted me dicked
And monty licked, so try an' make it real quick
Ah yeah, i jumped in the f-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store main
I got to get some gum and some tic-tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of blackjack
We got the goods, now we're headed for the hoe down
There goes the tele, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load into eighteen
But law low cause i really don't wanna be seen
Is this the one? aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black bod and you got the white one
So hit the light an', i just might man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so strung, that she'll drop some melt
So i can catch turf and hit another hotel from: ""if you lived here, you'd be home now.""",30,261

I'm conscious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skins 'cause it's a long trim
Front row seats, aiyo, I know she's on the nine inch

Just to get a piece of the green but she's an undertaker
Now you know the Paper is an around the world heart-breaker

Paid in full, so now you know why my belly's round

Just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, takin' it to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your women, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me

It make a man say, ""Damn""
I'm finally taxin' more, play than homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is help up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this groove in ninety two
Hey, you don't bother me and I sure never won't bother you

And ah, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagra
Think before you step, because these niggas just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold lex 'cause I got it made
I brought the beat on once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you

Just do the ditty, ditty if you want to

Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, all should be happy with ding-dong
It's since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nickel and dime nigga be like
""See, don't you remember me?""
A hustler, and his snow with more hoes to lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove

Pick up the mic and all of a sudden I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight behind my hoes so miss me with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin
Tote on his ass when I scoop him 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty, ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go
Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lexo, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'what's up witcha?', you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection

And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous, while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree, and then jock, that's a pitty
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the ditty
Yeah

now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you.
Yeah yeah, I missed you.

And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard,
don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
to anyone, anywhere,
I don't understand if you really care,
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no.

So I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up,
and this woman was singing my song:
lover's in love, and the other's run away,
lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay.

Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
dying since the day they were born.
Well, well, this is not that;
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown.

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure. You try to tell me that I'm clever,
but that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you.

You said that I was naive,
and I thought that I was strong.
I thought, ""hey, I can leave, I can leave.""
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you.
Yeah, I missed you.

You said you caught me cuz u want me and one day you'll let me go.
""You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose.

Call your boys cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home 
Should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight 
You're goin' solo 
Cut her off cause she talk some noise 
You know you got the right to get your party on 
So get your haircut and your car washed too 
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit 
You need to look your best cause you're turnin' heads tonight 
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night 
If you wanna

Go, go, go, go, go, go

We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck
But homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll the weed up!
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot.""
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You the faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up.""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

Hey girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man

You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest

And its better for me to let it go now 
than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same 
and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 
cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same 
and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 
cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me 
that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me 
that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)
