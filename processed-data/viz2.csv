I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some

Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love

we're just one big family.

Do you want to, come on, scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
C'mon let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

So let's go there
Let's go there
C'mon let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Still up high I'm strong enough 
To take these dreams and make them mine (x2)

And i turned on those kc lights and drove all night

Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords

And I don't think I can look at this the same 
But all the miles that separate 
They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face 

I'm here without you baby 
But you're still on my lonely mind 
I think about you baby 
And I dream about you all the time 
I'm here without you baby 
But you're still with me in my dreams 
And tonight, it's only you and me 

The miles just keep rolling 
As the people leave their way to say hello 
I've heard this life is overrated 
But I hope that it
Gets better as we go 

I'm here without you baby 
But you're still on my lonely mind 
I think about you baby 
And I dream about you all the time 
I'm here without you baby 
But you're still with me in my dreams 
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me 

Everything I know, and anywhere I go 
It gets hard but it won't take away my love 
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done 
It gets hard but it won't take away my love 

I'm here without you baby 
But you're still on my lonely mind

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
""Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

Yeah humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind

Of what will be with you and me

When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell

Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
My cup shall always be full

And I forseek the dark ahead if I stay

First rule, never let them change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can<U+2019>t do
And they hate that, they want to paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don<U+2019>t accept, and what they don<U+2019>t see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they<U+2019>re not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She<U+2019>s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she don<U+2019>t see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There<U+2019>s not a thing that I would change
Cause you<U+2019>re amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you<U+2019>re amazing
Just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she<U+2019>d let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy
She<U+2019>s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I<U+2019>d never ask you to change
If perfect is what you<U+2019>re searching for
Then just stay the same
So don<U+2019>t even bother asking if you look okay
You know I<U+2019>ll say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don<U+2019>t feel then you don<U+2019>t you feel it
Don<U+2019>t conceal it, don<U+2019>t be fair
You look great don't need silicone to build it/or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don<U+2019>t get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you<U+2019>re amazing
Just the way you are

Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin',

Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,

In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

That you will hold me dear

You never could get it
Unless you were fed it

Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen

He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be

At exactly the right time

And they're tan to the top all the way

We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing

With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting

We just know that the fight ain't fair

[Verse 1]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm.""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side

Hey sugar what you gotta say?

She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, You're beautiful

If I wasn't a eight-figga nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low

and when I got home
Before I said amen

after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway

Our song is the slammin' screen door

Our song is the way you laugh,

waitin' for something to come along
that was as good as our song

Neither less or more

At night I realize that no one else
Could ever take your place

It?s just a place in the sun
Where our love?s begun

So get ready for this
Y'all ready for this?

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in, get ready for this

We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sing?
Movin' up and down, dancin' on the ground
Feelin' kinda free security
How's this sound that moves you from the ground

Step back, relax, don't you wanna come in?
When I start rappin' the girlies wanna come in
Into my house, into my room
That's the part where it goes, boom, boom

Name here is Ray, the group is 2 Unlimited
We've got a lot to say
To you, ah yeah and your other crew
If it is a dream, boom see boom",34,164,"1992-09-19"

I was yours and you were mine
Forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry

And all the lines you wrote to me were lies
Months roll past the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily

The love I thought I'd won
You give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Hey

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get to time too often on AM Radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over I'm watching the lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
I found out about you",34,111,"1993-11-20"
