Hold on -- there's too many in the wolf pack\nAnd besides, Dirty Cash talking to her\nBuying her fake furs and taking her to The Fever\nQuiet as it's kept, that ain't even his Benz\nShe spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends\nMaterial girl, living in a material world\nBut it's all right cause it's Saturday night\nSo mister funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees\nAnd all you college students, play your Ouijas\nCheck the spelling: r-e-f-u-g-e-e, get the CD from Sam Goody, hee hee!\nYou ain't even close with the rhymes that you wrote\nDon't be mad cause you broke\nLet me clear my throat -- ah huh ah huh\nJohn Forte, grab the mic, let's sway this way\n\n[Verse 2: John Forte]\nI'm more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer\nHoping that the game treat that ass a little kinder\nEvery step tango'd\nYour beef don't concern me\nI'm eating mangoes in Trinidad with attorneys\nMy crew's slang flow worldwide like a current\nWith the every spot where nobody got insurance\nBrother, do the math -- you ain't half near exotic\nMy man's claim true; you -- forget about it\nPo-po just a nuisance, like my influence\nWell, recognize you a lie trying do it\nGot juiceâ€”told your lady\nOops!
