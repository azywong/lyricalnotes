Baby I Love Your Way, everyday, Yeah\r\nUh baby I love your way, everyday\r\n\r\nShadows grow so long before my eyes\r\nAnd they're moving across the page\r\nSuddenly the day turns into night\r\nFar away from the city\r\nWell, don't hesitate,\r\n'cause your love just won't wait...\r\n\r\nOoo, baby, I love your way, everyday\r\nWanns tell you I love your way, everyday\r\nWanna be with you night and day\r\n\r\nThe moon appears to shine and light the skies\r\nWith the help of some fireflies\r\nI wonder how they have the power to shine\r\nI can see them under the pine\r\nBut don't hesitate,\r\n'cause your love won't wait...\r\n\r\nOoo, baby, I love your way, everyday\r\nWanna tell you I love your way, everyday\r\nWanna be with you night and day\r\n\r\n(solo)\r\n\r\nI can see the sunset in your eyes\r\nBrown and grey, blue besides\r\nClouds are stalking islands in the sun\r\nI wish I could buy one out of season\r\nBut don't hesitate,\r\n'cause your love won't wait, just won't wait\r\n\r\nOoo, baby, I love your way, everyday\r\nWanna tell you I love your way, everyday\r\nWanna be with you night and day\r\n\r\nOoo, baby, I love your way\r\nWanna tell you I love your way\r\nWanna be with you night and day\r\n\r\nOoo, baby, I love your way\r\nWanna tell you I love your way...\r\nBaby I Love Your Way"}
