Did you eat yet?\nLet me hang up your coat. Pass me your hat\"\nAll the time she's smiling\nNever once raises her voice\nIt's five o'clock in the morning\nYou don't give it a second thought\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\n(repeat)\n\nThe sweetest woman in the world\nCould be the meanest woman in the world\nIf you make her that way\nYou keep hurting her\nShe'll keep being quiet\nShe might be holding something inside\nThat'll really, really hurt you one day\nI see you in the hospital\nBandaged from foot to head\nIn a state of shock\nJust that much from being dead\nYou couldn't believe the girl\nWould do something like this, ha\nYou didn't think the girl had the nerve\nBut here you are I guess action speaks louder than words\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\n(repeat)"}
