So what? Who cares?\nYou just got lucky that's all!\n...shut-up!\nDon't wanna hear another word\nabout candlelight and long stem roses\nand how you've fallen head over heals\nIn love... So what? Big deal!\n\nHe's perfect... I heard ya...\nThe first ten times that you told me!\nYeah, yeah it's amazing, his loving,\nI can't believe I let him go\nI regret it, there I said it!\nYou call yourself a friend but just keep rubbin' it in\n\nBig deal! So what? Who cares?\nYou just got lucky that's all\n...I swear, If I hear another word\nabout candlelight and long stem roses\nand how you've fallen head over heals\nIn love... So what? Big deal!\n\nCongratulations, I'm just so happy for you\nI can't contain the way I feel!\n\nBig deal! Big deal! So what? Who cares?\nYou just got lucky that's all\n...shut-up!\nDon't wanna hear another word\nabout candlelight and long stem roses\nand how you've fallen head over heals\nIn love... So what? Big deal!\nIn love... So what? Big deal!\n(Oh-oh it's a real big deal)\nBig deal! Oh yeah!\n(Oh-oh it's a real big deal)\nBig deal!\n(Oh-oh it's a real big deal)\nIn love... So what? Shut up!\nOh-oh it's a real big deal!\n"}
