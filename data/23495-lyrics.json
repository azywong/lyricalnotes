Yeaa!\n\n[Hook]\nShe's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama\nFirst you get her name, then you get her number\nThen you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer\nThen you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer\n\n[Verse 1]\nGucci, let me set the record straight:\nHater: you participate\n3 girls with me like I'm going on Elimidate\nSay you got a man, but your man ain't here\nThe ice in my ear shine like a chandelier\nJumping out the phantom, don't you think I'm handsome?\nWatch on my wrist cost more than a mansion\nBet your baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be\nGot your baby mama front seat of my Ferrari\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nGucci, Gucci Mane La Flare. Baby, I'm that guy\nGirls' eyeballs pop when they see when my Lamb' pass by\nMy money long as a limo\nJust to show off, I put my wrist out the window\nI ride through the 6, little kids scream \"bingo!\"\nI fell off in the spotlight, ay, lets mingle\nThen the DJ play my new single\nThe club got crazy, all the girls went psycho\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nGucci! Don't be conceited, girl\nI know you're freaky, girl\nI know your secret, girl\nBut I'm gonna keep it, girl\nOh, you's a college girl?\nGo on and be a Gucci girl\nOh, you's a Gucci fan?\nLet's go to Gucciland\nYou dig a Gucci man\nCause only Gucci can\nDrop a rack, pop your back with a rubberband\nYou diggin Gucci, Gucci\nLet's do the oochi-coochi\nOh, that's your girlfriend?\nWhy don't you introduce me"}
