She hypnotize me with her hips, man\n(Yeah)\nI sweet talking her if she like\n'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right\nLook, I'm legit now, used to break laws\nNow you can reap the benefit of world tours\nBig house, big Benz, girl, it yours\nMink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws\nYou ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you\nAll you gotta do is love me and be loyal\nDon't Indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you\n'Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you\nCome here, let my touch on you, I let you touch on me\nPut my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me\nLet me ride on you and you can ride on\nWe can do it all the night, we can have a balla night\nI wanna get to know you\nI really wanna fuck you, baby\nI'm lost in your lovin'\nI'm simply going to drive you crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nI'm lost in your lovin'\nI'm simply going to drive you crazy\nI wanna be your lawyer\nI really wanna defend you, baby\nI'm lost in your lovin'\nI'm simply gonna try you, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nI'm lost in your lovin'\nI'm simply gonna try you, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI really need to stand you, baby\nI wanna be your lover\nI really need to stand you, baby\nBaby, baby, baby"}
