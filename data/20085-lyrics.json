So I can understand\nIf you love me, how could you hurt me like that\nHow could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away?\nHow could the one who said, \"I love you,\" say the things you say?\nHow could the one I was so true to, just tell me lies?\nHow could the one I gave my heart to, go and break this heart of mine, tell me?\n\n[Bridge 1]\nHow could you be so cold to me\nWhen I gave you everything?\nAll my love, all I had inside\nHow could you just walk out the door?\nHow could you not love me anymore?\nI thought we had forever, I can't understand\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHow could the one I shared my dreams with, take my dreams from me?\nHow could the love that brought such pleasure, bring such misery?\nWon't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please\nIf you love me how could you do that to me, tell me?\n\n[Bridge 2]\nHow could you just walk out the door?\nHow could you not love me anymore?\nI thought we had forever\nI can't understand\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHow could the one I gave my heart to, break my heart so bad?\nHow could the one who made me happy, make me feel so sad?\nWon't somebody tell me? So I can understand\nIf you love me how could you hurt me like that?\nHow could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away?\nHow could the one who said, \"I love you,\" say the things you say?\nHow could the one I was so true to, just tell me lies?\n\n[Outro]\nHow could the one I gave my heart to\nHow could the one I gave my heart to\nHow could the one I gave my heart to\nBreak this heart of mine, tell me?"}
