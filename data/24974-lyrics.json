You better listen to me.\"\n\n[Bridge]\nHe said, \"Change your style, whiten your smile\nYou could lose a couple pounds\nIf you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife\nDo you need your friends around?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, no that's not me\n'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family\nAnd I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt\n'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be\n\n'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive\nYou'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five\nI've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks\nAnd as a country boy, I know I can survive\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel\nOne is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue\nThe other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made\n\"Don't tread on me\" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause, this is me\nI'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs\nAnd I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand\nAnd I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land\nAnd a country boy, is all I'll ever be\n\n[Outro:Charlie Daniels]\nI love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now\nAnd anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me\nThat should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son"}
