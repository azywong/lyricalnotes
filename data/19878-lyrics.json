And The Boyz\nNow that we've found found love\nWhat are we gonna do with it. (x2)\nOne two, tell me what you got\nLet me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot\nRev me up Rev me up\nMy little buttercup\nWe can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck\nBelieve it or not\nHere comes the brother with glow\nA strugglin', Bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone\nSo what's it gonna be\nMe or the TV\nNow let me take time to set your mind and your body free\nSo why don't you just stretch\nStretch for a sec\n???\nShake me, Shake me\nBaby Baby bake me\nNo need to fake here I am\nCome on and take me\nWind your body\nBaby move your body\nI see you slip sliding\nCome on now do it hottie\nI'm not quite sure as to what is going down\nBut I'm feeling Hunky Dory\n'bout this thing that I found\n\n(CHORUS X2)\nI dig the way you wiggle\nYou don't jiggle\nOnce you jiggle\nSo hand over your love\nCause it's heavier\nThan it'll\nMove like a Mover\nSye wanted to groove\nSo I grooved her\nThen she wanted to learn\nSo we'd be schoolin'\nSo I schooled her\n(Mary had a little lamb)\nBut not like this\nWe can waltz and turn\nRumble tumble and twist\nThen you think you gonna give in\nPhantasies relivin'\nSo lay down and relax\nLover my lady\nLady love of my baby girl\nSpread your wings\nSo we can fly around the world\n???\nWhen you drop me kisses\nYou're so cute you drop the bomb on me\nStretch it\nStretch it\nFlex it\nFlex it\nGimme the permission\nOkey, Dokey\nI'll bless ya\nBlessin' like buddha\nBuddha as the bless\nYou can lay down on the Lover\nPut your head on my chest\n\n(CHORUS X2)\nWhat can we do\nWhat are we gonna do\nRoses are red and Violets are blue\nLove is good and plenty\nIf you get plenty good lovin'\n???\nDo me right\nDo me right\nMy lonesome dove\nTell me one more time\nWhat is this thing called love\nI'm not quite sure\nAs to what is going down\nBut I'm feelin' Hunkey Dory\n'Bout this thing that I found"}
