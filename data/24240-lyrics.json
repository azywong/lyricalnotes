Think about it, doesn't matter\nand if it makes you feel good then I say do it,\nI don't know what you're waiting for\n\nFeel my temperature rising\nThere's too much heat I'm gonna' lose control\nDo you want to go higher, get closer to the fire,\nI don't know what you're waiting for\n\nCome join the party, yeah\nCoz' anybody just won't do.\nLet's get this started, yeah\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you.\n\nBoy you got a reputation, but you're gonna' have to prove it\nI see a little hesitation,\nAm I gonna' have to show you that if it feels right,\nGet on your marks\nStep to the beat boy that's what it's for\n\nPut your arms around me\nWhen it gets too hot we can go outside\nBut for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear\nAn invitation to the dance of life\n\nCome join the party, it's a celebration\nAnybody just won't do\nLet's get this started, no more hesitation\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you\n\nHaven't I seen you somewhere before?\nYou look familiar...\nYou wanna' dance? ...Yeah\nI guess I just don't recognize you with your cloths on... (laughs)\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nCome join the party, it's a celebration\nAnybody just won't do\nLet's get this started, no more hesitation\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you\n\nCome join the party, it's a celebration\nAnybody just won't do\nLet's get this started, no more hesitation\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you\n\nBoy you've got it, it's a celebration\nCoz' anybody just won't do\nLet's get it started, no more hesitation\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you\n\nBoy you've got it\nCoz' anybody just won't do\nLet's get it started, no more hesitation\nCoz' everybody wants to party with you"}
