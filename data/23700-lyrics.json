You dig?\nMack, I'm going in\n\n[Verse 1]\nA millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire\nTougher than Nigerian hair\nMy criteria compared to your career just isn't fair\nI'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed\nThrough the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind\n‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time\n‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar\nAnd the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper\nSister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper\nGot the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'\nTell the coppers: \"Ha-ha-ha-ha\nYou can't catch him, you can't stop him\"\nI go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em\nYou can't man 'em, then you mop 'em\nYou can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em\nYou pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher\n\n[Hook]\nMotherfucker, I'm ill\n\n[Verse 2]\nA million here, a million there\nSicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere\nLike smoke in the thinnest air\nI open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me\nLike, \"Look at that bastard Weezy!\"\nHe's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem\nOkay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?\nNothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'\nOn some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman\nCall me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!\nNever answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch\nDon't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch\nAnd she ain't shy no more: she changed her name to My Bitch\nYeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask\nFor the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!\nIt ain't trickin' if you got it\nBut you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shit\nMotherfucker, I'm ill, not sick\nAnd I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick\nYeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it\n\n[Hook]\nMotherfucker, I'm ill\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac\nAndré 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?\nWho that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?\nMy name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man\nWho that one that do that, boy?\nYou knew that, true that, swallow\nAnd I be the shit, now you got loose bowels\nI don't owe you like two vowels\nBut I would like for you to pay me by the hour\nAnd I'd rather be pushin' flowers\nThan to be in the pen sharin' showers\nTony told us this world was ours\nAnd the Bible told us every girl was sour\nDon't play in her garden and don't smell her flower\nCall me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower\nBoy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey\nEven Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me\nMotherfucker, I say: \"Life ain't shit without me.\"\nChrome lips pokin' out the coupé, look like it's poutin'\nI do what I do, and you do what you can do about it\nBitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me!\nDon't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me\nThey don't see me but they hear me\nThey don't feel me but they fear me; I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat"}
