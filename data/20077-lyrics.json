Where you goin? Who you out with?\nThem same niggas I make moves and I shout with\nDon't let these niggas in the street get your head up\nLike they can do better than me\nPlus I'm fed up\nI had to tell my main chick that one time\nThinkin to me short \nShe thought that I'm\nSome clown nigga she can scream on and talk to \nI had to run her down the line this aint no walk through \nNow who the fuck you think you talkin to chick\nYour complaining's makin me sick \nUnderstand man I tried to do my thing\nYo understand I played the puppet on the string\nLike I say everyday I be there fo rmy friend\nGood things always come to an end\nSo yo\n\nChorus\n\nVerse Four:\n\nSee the moral of this is that I really do care\nBut I'm not afraid to go there\nVery unselfish and yes I do share\nYou could have your bitch but you gets nowhere\nWord\nShe began by saying try after try\nIt's a done deal\nNow I'm singing byebye\nAll I tried to do was keep you satisfied\nNever dealing with no others I try\nTo many threats kid \nGot to let her go\nAlways in your corner \nGot to let her know\nAs I grab my coat and painfully walked out\nHands about to give\nWe talked out\nI'm feeling pain as it come to an end\nI said to shorty \"I will always be your friend\"\nNow if you ever need me I will be right there\nI aint going nowhere\nFor real\n\nChorus\n"}
