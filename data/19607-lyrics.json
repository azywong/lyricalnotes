No\n\nSo tear me open, but beware\nThe pain's inside without a care\nAnd the dirt still stains me\nSo wash me til I'm clean\n\nI'll Tear me open, make you gone\nNo longer will you hurt anyone\nAnd the hate still shapes me\nSo hold me until it sleeps\nUntil it sleeps\nUntil it sleeps\nUntil it sleeps"}
