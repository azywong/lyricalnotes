Love.\nAnd what is it\nThat can make the coldest day seem warm? Love.\nAnd what is it\nThat can bring a smile through to a stranger?\n\nI believe in the power of love\nI believe\n(repeat 2x)\n\nLet them call me naïve.\nI still believe.\n\nPower of love\n(repeat 4x)\n\nWhat is it\nThat can make a lost soul found? Love.\nAnd what is it\nThat can make the coldest day seem warm?\nLove.\nAnd what is it\nThat can bring a smile through to a stranger?\n\nGive it everything\nCause what you give\nYou get so\ngive it everything\nOpen your heart.\n\nI believe\n(repeat out)\n"}
