You need to listen \nI'm starting to trip \nI'm losing my grip \nand I'm in this thing alone\n\nCrying out loud\nI'm crying out loud\ncrying out loud \nI'm crying out loud\n\nOpen your eyes\nopen up wide\n\nWhy should I care?\nCause you weren't there \nwhen I was scared \nI was so alone\n\nWhy should I care?\nCause you weren't there \nwhen I was scared\nI was so alone\n\nWhy should I care?\nIf you don't care \nthen I don't care\nwe're not going anywhere\n\nWhy should I care?\nCause you weren't there \nwhen I was scared\nI was so alone\n\nWhy should I care?\nif you don't care \nthen I don't care\nwe're not going anywhere"}
