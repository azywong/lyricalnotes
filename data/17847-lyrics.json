(Used to be)\nIs there any chance\nI just can't believe you're not lonely too\nJust for me and you\n\nBaby, can you stop the rain from falling?\nWon't you chase my clouds away?\nI'd give anything to see the sun again\nOnly you can stop these tears from falling\nI can't face another day\nBaby, can you stop\nCan you stop the rain?\nOh, oh\n\nIf you are here for only one night\nBaby, I know you remember\nâ€˜Cause loving you once wasn't time enough\nI know we can make it together, together\n\nBaby, stop the rain\nWon't you chase the clouds away?\nI'd give anything to see the sun again\nOnly you can stop these tears of mine from falling\nI can't face another day\nBaby, can you stop\nCan you, can you stop the rain?\n\nCan you stop the rain?\nYeah\nOh, oh, oh\nHow can I live without you, baby?\nI've gotta let you go, yeah\nChase my clouds away"}
