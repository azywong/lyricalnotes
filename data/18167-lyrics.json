It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\nI like big butts and I cannot lie\nYou other brothers can't deny\nThat when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist\nAnd a round thing in your face\nYou get sprung, wanna pull up tough\n'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed\nDeep in the jeans she's wearin'\nI'm hooked and I can't stop starin'\nOh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha\nAnd take your picture\nMy homeboys tried to warn me\nBut that butt you got makes (me so horny!)\nOh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin\nYou say you wanna get in my Benz?\nWell, use me, use me\n'Cause you ain't that average groupie\nI've seen 'em dancin'\nTo hell with romancin'\nShe's wet, wet\nGot it goin' like a turbo 'Vette\nI'm tired of magazines\nSayin' flat butts are the thing\nTake the average black man and ask him that\nShe gotta pack much back\nSo, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)\nHas your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)\nTell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)\nShake that healthy butt!\nBaby got back!\n\n[Hook: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\n(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)\nBaby got back!\n\n[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\nI like 'em round, and big\nAnd when I'm throwin' a gig\nI just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal\nNow here's my scandal\nI wanna get you home\nAnd ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh\nI ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy\n'Cause silicone parts are made for toys\nI want 'em real thick and juicy\nSo find that juicy double\nMix-a-Lot's in trouble\nBeggin' for a piece of that bubble\nSo I'm lookin' at rock videos\nKnock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes\nYou can have them bimbos\nI'll keep my women like Flo Jo\nA word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha\nI won't cuss or hit ya\nBut I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*\n'Til the break of dawn\nBaby got it goin' on\nA lot of simps won't like this song\n'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it\nAnd I'd rather stay and play\n'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong\nAnd I'm down to get the friction on\nSo, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)\nIf you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)\nThen turn around! Stick it out!\nEven white boys got to shout\nBaby got back!\n\n[Hook: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\nBaby got back!\n\n[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\n\"Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3\".\"\n\n[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]\nSo your girlfriend rolls a Honda\nPlayin' workout tapes by Fonda\nBut Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda\nMy anaconda don't want none\nUnless you've got buns, hun\nYou can do side bends or sit-ups\nBut please don't lose that butt\nSome brothers wanna play that hard role\nAnd tell you that the butt ain't gold\nSo they toss it and leave it\nAnd I pull up quick to retrieve it\nSo Cosmo says you're fat\nWell I ain't down with that!\n'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'\nAnd I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'\nTo the beanpole dames in the magazines:\nYou ain't it, Miss Thing!\nGive me a sista, I can't resist her\nRed beans and rice didn't miss her\nSome knucklehead tried to diss\n'Cause his girls are on my list\nHe had game but he chose to hit 'em\nAnd I pull up quick to get wit 'em\nSo ladies, if the butt is round\nAnd you want a triple X go down\nDial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT\nAnd kick them nasty thoughts\nBaby got back!\n\n[Outro]\nBaby got back!\nLittle in the middle but she got much back!"}
