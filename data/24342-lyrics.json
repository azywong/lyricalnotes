Hey, bust a move!\n\n[New Direction Girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will with New Directions Boys:]\nJust bust a move!\n\n[New Direction Girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will:]\nIn this city, ladies look pretty\nGuys tell jokes so they can seem witty\nTell a funny joke just to get some play\nThen you try to make a move and she says, \"No way\"\nGirls are fakin', goodness sakin'\nThey want a man who brings home the bacon\nGot no money and you got no car\nThen you got no woman and there you are\nSome girls are sadistic, materialistic\nLooking for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\nSo on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there, bust a move!\n\n[New Directions Girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will and New Directions Boys]\nJust bust a move!\n\n[New Directions Girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will:]\nBreak it down for me, fellas\n\nYour best friend Harry has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\n'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man\nYou say \"neat-o\", check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\nSo you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'\nA bridemaid looks and thinks that you're winkin'\nShe thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back\nAnd then you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked\nReception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wants to dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do, G, bust a move!\n\n[New Direction girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will and New Directions Boys:]\nJust bust a move!\n\n[New Directions Girls:]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou want it, baby, you got it\n\n[Will:]\nMove it, boy"}
