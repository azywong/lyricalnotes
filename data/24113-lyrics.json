Are you pistol-whipped?\nDo you step in line or release the glitch?\nCan you fall asleep with a panic switch?\n\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room,\nDo you think I'll snitch? Are you pistol whipped?\nDo you step in line or release the glitch?\nDo you think she'll sleep with a panic?\n\nAnd I'll try to hold on tight tonight.\nPink slip, inviting me inside.\nI want to burn skin and brand what once was mine,\nBut the red news came ripping in to fight.\n\nIf I go anywhere that you want me to go,\nHow do I know you'll still follow?\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\n\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nWaiting and fading and floating away\nWaiting and fading and floating away\nWaiting and fading and flailing and fading\n\n[Chorus]"}
