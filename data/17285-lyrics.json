There just ain't a one!\nBut when we get together\nWe have nothin' but fun\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\n\n[Breakdown]\nYou know it, baby, baby\nWe come together\nWe come together\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby ain't it somethin'\nHow we lasted this long?\nYou and me\nProvin' everyone wrong\nDon't think we'll ever\nGet our differences patched\nDon't really matter\nCuz we're perfectly matched\n\n[Chorus] (x2)"}
