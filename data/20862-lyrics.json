I've been waiting for you.\nCause last night I had something so good\nThese days get so long and I got nothing to do\"\n\nI been hanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town so long\nI been hanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town for way too long\n\nWe spend all day getting sober\nJust hiding from daylight\nWatching TV\nWe just look a lot better in the blue light\nWell, you know I gotta get out\nBut I'm stuck so tight\nWeighed by the chains that keep me...\n\nhanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town too long\nI been hanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town for way too long\n\nAnd this girl listens to the band play\nShe says \"where have you been?\nI've been lyin right here on the floor\"\n\nWell, I got all this time\nTo be waiting for what is mine\nTo be hating what I am\nAfter the light has faded\n\nhanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town so long\nI been hanginaround this town on the corner\nI been bummin' around this old town for way, way,\nway, way, way too long\n"}
