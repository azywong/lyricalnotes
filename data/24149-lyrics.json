(Repeated until end of the song)\n\n[Finn:]\nJust a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world\nShe took the midnight train goin' anywhere\n\n[Rachel:]\nJust a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit\nHe took the midnight train goin' anywhere\n\n[Finn:]\nA singer in a smoky room\n\n[Rachel:]\nA smell of wine and cheap perfume\n\n[Both:]\nFor a smile they can share the night\nIt goes on and on and on and on\n\nStrangers waiting, up and down the boulevard\nTheir shadows searching in the night\nStreetlight people, living just to find emotion\nHiding, somewhere in the night\n\n[Rachel:]\nWorkin' hard to get my fill\nEverybody wants a thrill\n\n[Both:]\nPayin' anything to roll the dice\nJust one more time\n\n[Rachel:]\nSome will win, some will lose\n\n[Both:]\nSome are born to sing the blues\nAnd oh, the movie never ends\nIt goes on and on and on and on\n\nStrangers waiting, up and down the boulevard\nTheir shadows searching in the night\nStreetlight people, livin' just to find emotion\nHiding, somewhere in the night\n\n[New Directions:]\nDon't stop believin'\nHold on to that feelin'\nStreetlight people\n\nDon't stop believin'\nHold on to that feelin'\nStreetlight people\n\nDon't stop!"}
