I'm not Ginuwine\nAin't tryna spend no time\nI know my bitch she so fine\nBut I don't know what's on her mind\nGotta pay that cost to be a boss\nI put on my Louboutins playing golf\nYoung nigga walking with Nina Ross\nI'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know why I came in this club with you, girl\nDon't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain\nSurrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?\nIs it cause a nigga cook like a professor?\nI don't know how you feel can you tell me\nI won't know how you feel 'til you tell me\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy\n\n[Verse 2: Takeoff]\nThey say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite\nI'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly\nThe dope that I sell is the purest\nThe junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'\nThe flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'\nMy nigga you know we invented it\nDripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic\nI'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant\nI got the boot but no Timberland\nI am the plug, you the middle man\nI never leave my niggas starvin'\nYou niggas mistake me for Marvin\nI got 15 bricks I'm finna drop\nIn there right next to that carbon\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know why I came in this club with you, girl\nDon't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain\nSurrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?\nIs it cause a nigga cook like a professor?\nI don't know how you feel can you tell me\nI won't know how you feel 'til you tell me\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy\n\n[Verse 3: Offset]\nIs it my looks or is it my wealth?\nOr is it the way that I carry myself?\nLet me know I need some help\nDon't keep that secret to yourself\nBitches be saying I'm acting funny\nCause a young nigga got a lotta money\nShe lookin' at me like she want somethin'\nCan't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds\nShe sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses\nbaby girl you trippin'\n(I don't know how you feel can you tell me)\nI know why you came in this club tonight\nLooking for a nigga that's gon' change your life\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know why I came in this club with you, girl\nDon't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain\nSurrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?\nIs it cause a nigga cook like a professor?\nI don't know how you feel can you tell me\nI won't know how you feel 'til you tell me\nIs it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy"}
