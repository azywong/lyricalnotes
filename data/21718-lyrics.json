Baby, TQ, Mannie Fresh)\n\n[MANNIE FRESH: Talking] (Lil' Wayne)\nLook'a here... (Umm-hmm...)\nThis how we gon' do this...\nHook up the turntables,\nWolfe, get on the keyboard...\nAnd we gon' run it, ya heard...\n\n[MANNIE, BABY, & WAYNE]\n[**Talking**]\n\n[GIRL]\nCash Money..\nCash Money..\nCash Money..\nCash Money..\n\n[LIL' WAYNE & BABY: Verse 1]\n[LIL' WAYNE]\nNow let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins,\nHit the mall with my girlfriends, dish out ends.\nCause you know it ain't trickin' if you got it,\nCop baby girl what she desire, it's chump change mama.\nMarijuana Scholar... Knowin' what I got up in my styrofoam cup?\nThat purple stuff. It was givin' to me at birth to stunt.\nSo that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the fur in the guts.\n\n[BABY of Big Tymers] (Ay, Ay, Ay..)\nHold on, mami! Them whips on dubs.\nCadillac truck, twenty-eights, no rubs.\nSlide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eye lens,\nCar show in New York, Ya'll know who wins!\nIt's the birdman, daddy, with the Gucci and Prada,\nSlant-back, cut truck. No rims? Can't holla.\nIt's that Louie/Fendi on Ostrich streets,\nIt's the tailer-made daddy, Mami, do you love me?\n\n[TQ: Hook (Mannie Fresh)]\nBaby, I'ma a stunna.. (Oh! Oh! Oh!)\nI ain't gon' change it.. (I told ya'll...)\nDon't - you - know, \nIt's a way of liffeee... (I told ya'll...)\nMama, do you want it?\nCause I'm about to break it, (I told ya'll...)\nOooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',\nNooo, nooo... (Bring back that beat...)\n\n[BABY & LIL' WAYNE: Verse 2]\n[BABY of Big Tymers]\nPop one, pop two.. Them new Nike shoes,\nRoyal blue Jag on them twenty-two's.\nFlip white to green, 500 Degreez,\nIn that Cadillac truck on them twenty-three's.\nI'm the boss of the game with the money and fame,\nAll these naked women that pop champagne.\nAnd these marble floors stay high as Rick James,\nIf you know my name, then you know my game.\n\n[LIL' WAYNE]\nIt's lil' whodi from the hot block with ser'ous flow,\nGotta get dough, cause ya'll won't feel me, bro.\nBut ya'll don't here me tho...\nTill I'm rollin' down my window and my grill-ie show.\nAnd you know I'm prolly pumpin' through the hood on the twenty-fo's,\nWord! Rims pokin' out the side of the 'ERV,\nGlock have ya ribs pokin' out the side of ya shirt.\nI'm a seventeenth nigga and I ride for the turf. Whoo!\n\n[TQ: Hook (Mannie Fresh)]\nBaby, I'ma a stunna.. (I told ya'll...)\nI ain't gon' change it..\nDon't - you - know,\nIt's a way of liffeee... (I told ya'll...)\nMama, do you want it?\nCause I'm about to break it,\nOooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',\nNooo, nooo...\n\n[LIL' WAYNE & BABY: Verse 3]\n[LIL' WAYNE] Ay...\nAnd my pinky glow... Cause my ring is so...\nBlingy-blingy, yo... Stop blinkin' though...\nWe smoke - stinky, stinky dro,\nAnd we don't cop them ency-wency O's,\nAnd we don't stop. Nah! We blow, fuck the peo-ple!\nEverywhere we go, we smell like E-yo.\nThe birdman my paw, so that make me go...\n\"Fllyy like an eagle!\" Fo' sheezo!\n\n[BABY (Lil' Wayne)]\nThey think cause I stay at English Turn,\nThat Stunna don't have a O - Z to burn, (Light it up!)\nI go in each sto' and ball like a dog,\nMe and my nig's, we ball like a dog.\nCars on the streets, all on our lawn.\nIce in my teeths, all on my arm.\nTat's in my face, my back, and my arm. (What?)\n\n[LIL' WAYNE]\nTat's in MY face, my back, and my arm.\n\n[TQ: Hook] \nBaby, I'ma a stunna.. \nI ain't gon' change it..\nDon't - you - know,\nIt's a way of liffeee... \nMama, do you want it?\nCause I'm about to break it,\nOooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',\nNooo, nooo...\n\n[MANNIE FRESH: Talking]\nYep!... There it is!.. ya' lil' low-life...\nSee, I'm a pro - fessional. You a rookie.\nFuckin' game so serious...\nI could sell a hooker some pussy...\nNow, that's some serious shit...\nOh, yea! Bel'ieve that!\nWho we rollin' wit?\nWe rollin' wit Cash Money!\nOh, I forgot about \"peace\"!\nPEEACE! I mean... \"Piece\" of pussy,\n\"Piece\" of land, \"Piece\" of property...\nIt's just a mind game...\n"}
