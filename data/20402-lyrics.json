Huh?\nBaby, Baby tell me what's up?\nCan you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?\nHuh? what?\nBaby, Baby tell me what's up?\nCan you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?\nHuh? Huh?\nBaby, Baby tell me what's up?\nCan you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?\nHuh? Huh?\n\nBoy, this evening, was it only me\nFeeling completely down to be open\nDown to be open for some satisfaction\nDidn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction\n\nI knew it was wrong for feeling this way\nEspecially the thought of getting in on the first date\nCouldn't let go, it stayed on my mind\nAt the end of the night, I had to decide\nI was thinking\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI don't get down on the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI wanna get down, but not the first night\n\nWe were chillin, watching your TV\nI thought you were coming close as you got to me\nWanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you\nAnd somehow in one night, discover I love you\n\nFelt so right but it felt so wrong\nAnd look how we are carrying on\nTry to say things to get me to stay\nBut my watch tells me it's getting too late\nI'm thinking\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI don't get down on the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI don't get down on the first night\n\n(If) If you want me\nYou got to know me\nAnd if you want my love\nYou gotta win my love\n\nHey baby\nThat's the way it's got to be, yeah\nGet to know me, get to know me\nSo we can do this\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI wanna get down, but not the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI don't get down on the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI wanna get down, but not the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI don't get down on the first night\n\nI should make a move but I won't\nI know you're probably thinking something is wrong\nKnowing if I do that it won't be right\nI wanna get down, but not the first night"}
