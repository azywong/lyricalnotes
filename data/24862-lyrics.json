So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\nI fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago\nMercy, mercy me, that Murcielago\nThat's me, the first year that I blow\nHow you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo\nMe drown sorrow in that Diablo\nMe found bravery in my bravado\nDJs need to listen to the models\n\"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?\"\n(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)\nStupid, but what the hell do I know?\nI'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow\nAnd my chick in that new Phoebe Philo\nSo much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow\n\n[Hook: Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher?\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook like a fat booty Celine Dion\nSex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis\nBeyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher\nTell me how do you respond to students?\nAnd refresh the page and restart the memory?\nRespark the soul and rebuild the energy?\nWe stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies\nSorry for the night demons still visit me\nThe plan was to drink until the pain over\nBut what's worse, the pain or the hangover?\nFresh air, rollin' down the window\nToo many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low\nDon't make me pull the toys out, huh\nDon't make me pull the toys\nAnd fire up the engines, huh\nAnd then they make noise\n\n[Hook: Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Bridge: Bon Iver & Kanye West]\nAt the mall, there was a seance\nJust kids, no parents\nThen the sky filled with herons\n(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron\nAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us\nAnd the fires did declare us\nBut after that, took pills, kissed an heiress\nAnd woke up back in Paris\n\n[Hook: Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\nCan we get much higher? So high\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh"}
