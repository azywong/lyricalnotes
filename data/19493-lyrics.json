Oh baby \n\n[Chorus x 2]\n\nI once was blind but baby now I see \nThat I'm not the one \nWho can fill your every need \nI painted a picture so clear, it's reality \nNow I know, yes I know \nThat you're not the one for me \nOoooh baby, oh yeah \nWho do you love baby? \nIf you don't want me \nIf you don't need me \n\nHow could you walk away from me? \nBaby you promised you'd never leave \nSlept alone since you've been gone \nThe greatest pain I've ever known \nOh babe, oh babe oh yeah \n\n[Chorus x 2]\n"}
