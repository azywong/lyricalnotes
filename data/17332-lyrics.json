Richards/Jordan) \n\nI can almost hear you sigh \nI can almost hear you cry \nOn every crowded street \nAll the places we would meet \n\nWhat will I do without you \nThey say that life goes on \nI'm feeling sorry for myself \nI can't belive you're gone \n\nYou acted much too calm \nYou turned on all the charm \nYou had a cold look in your eyes \n\nI can feel your tongue on mine \nSilky smooth like wine \nI'm living with those memories \nThat's all that's left of you and me \n\nI can almost hear you sigh \nAlmost hear you cry \nWhen you made sweet love to me \nAnd you turned on all the charm \nActed much too calm \nYou had a cold look in your eyes \n\nDid it mean nothng \nWas it all in vain \nWas I just your fool \nOr was the pleasure pain \nHave you set me free \nOr will I wake up \nIn the morning \nAnd find out it's been a bad dream \n\nCome on, I beg you \nI want to be your main man \n\nI can almost hear you sigh \nAlmost hear you cry \nWhen you make sweet love to me \nAlmost see your smile \nIt stretched half a mile \nYou had a stone cold look in your eyes   \n"}
