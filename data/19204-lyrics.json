Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from cotton-eye joe?\n\n(repeat)\n\nHe came to town like a midwinter storm\nHe rode through the fields so handsome and strong\nHis eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun\nBut all he had come for was having some fun\n\n(repeat intro)\n\nHe brought disaster wherever he went\nThe hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent\nThey all ran away so nobody would know\nAnd left only men cause of cotton-eye joe\n\n(repeat intro)"}
