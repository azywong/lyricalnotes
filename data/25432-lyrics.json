Hmm\n\nBittersweet memories\nThat is all I'm taking with me\nSo, goodbye. Please, don't cry\nWe both know I'm not what you, you need\nAnd I will always love you\nI will always love you\n\nI hope life treats you kind\nAnd I hope you have all you've dreamed of\nAnd I wish to you, joy and happiness\nBut above all this, I wish you love\n\nAnd I will always love you\nI will always love you\nI will always love you\nI will always love you\nI will always love you\nI, I will always love you\nDarling, I love you\nOh I'll always, I'll always love you"}
