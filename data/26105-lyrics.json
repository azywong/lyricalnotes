That you make me strong\n\nThink of how much love that's been wasted\nPeople always try to escape it\nMove on to stop their heart breaking\nBut there's nothing I'm running from\nYou make me strong\n\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong?\nIs it so wrong?\n\nSo baby hold on to my heart\nNeed you to keep me from falling apart\nI'll always hold on\n'Cause you make me strong\n\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong?\nIs it so wrong?\n\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong?\nIs it so wrong?\nThat you make me strong\n\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong?\nIs it so wrong?\nThat you make me strong"}
