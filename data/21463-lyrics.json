Maybe, spiritual hero who appears in you\nTo clear your view when you're too crazy\nLifeless to those, the definition for what life is\nPriceless to you because I put you on the hype shit\nYou like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke\nPsychic among those, possess you with one go\n\n[Hook: 2D]\nI ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\nI got sunshine in a bag\nI'm useless, but not for long\nThe future is coming on\nI ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\nI got sunshine in a bag\nI'm useless, but not for long\nThe future is coming on\nIt's coming on, it's coming on\nIt's coming on, it's coming on\nIt's coming on…\n\n[Verse 2: Del]\nThe essence, the basics, without it, you naked\nAllow me to make this, childlike in nature\nRhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy\nI'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child of peace\nEvery cloud and sea, you see with your eyes\nI see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise\nFrom this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies\nThrough Russel, not his muscles\nBut the percussion he provides with me as a guide\nY'all can see me now, 'cause you don't see with your eye\nYou perceive with your mind; that's the inner\nSo I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor\nBust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember\nWhere the thought is, I brought all this\nSo you can survive when law is lawless\nFeelings, sensations that you thought was dead\nNo squealing, remember that it's all in your head\n\n[Hook: 2D]\nI ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\nI got sunshine in a bag\nI'm useless, but not for long\nThe future is coming on\nI ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\nI got sunshine in a bag\nI'm useless, but not for long\nThe future is coming on\nIt's coming on, it's coming on\nIt's coming on, it's coming on\nIt's coming on…"}
