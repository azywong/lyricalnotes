{"song_name":"Turn To You (Mother's Day Dedication)","artist_id":305459,"display_artist":"Justin Bieber","spotify_id":"0cZmqpfp5qvYFgM72hZAdg","lyrics":"You worked two jobs\nTo keep a roof above our heads,\nYou chose, a life for me, no never gave up, I admire you, For the strength you’ve instilled in me,\nYou were so young, You were just my age, when you had me mom, You were so brave. There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you will always be there for me\nSo when you’re lost and you’re tired\nWhen you’re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you\nI still turn to you, I still turn to you\nIt was ’94, the year that everything started to change, from before, You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways\n\nThen you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not\nIgnore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart\n\nSo when you’re lost and you’re tired\nWhen you’re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you\n\nI don’t know what I’d if you left me\nSo please don’t go away\nEverything that you are is who I am\nWho I am today\nSo when you’re lost and you’re tired\nWhen you’re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you\n\nTo you, to you, to you. I Still Turn to you. To you, to you, to you\nCauseI\nI turn to you"}
