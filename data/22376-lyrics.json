Somebody lied\nThey can bug my phone and people 'round my home\nThey'll only c U and me making love inside\n\n[Chorus]\n\nEye've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night Eye saw it with U\nIt let me know Eye'd never seen the moon b4\nSo many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws\nBut 2 compare it 2 a beauty like Urs would give 1 pause\nNothing about U is false, that's why Ur love is real\nGod 4bid if U belonged 2 another Eye'd have 2 steal U\nEye'd have 2 take U from Ur man\nEye might b tempted 2 break the law round here\nBecause Ur beauty, it gives 1 pause\nIt slows me down\n\n[Chorus]"}
