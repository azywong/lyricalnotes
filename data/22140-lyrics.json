Yeah, where my troopers at?\nWhere my hustlers, where my boosters at?\nI don't care what you do for stacks\nI know the world glued your back to the wall\nYou gotta brawl, do that\nI been through that, been shot at, shoot back\nGotta keep a peace like a Buddhist\nI ain't a New Jack; nobody gon' Wesley Snipe me\nIt's less than likely. Move back\nLet I breathe, Jedi Knight\nThe more space I get the better I write\nOh, never I write, but if ever I write\nI need the space to say whatever I like, now just\n\n[Hook: Jay-Z  & (Pharrell)]\n(Change clothes, and go)\nYou know I stay fresh to death, a boy from the projects\nAnd I'mma take you to the top of the globe, so let's go\n(So let's exchange numbers and go)\n(And girl I promise you, no substitutes) It's just me\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nAnd I ain't gon' tell you again, let's get ghost in the Phantom\nYou can bring your friend, we can make this a tandem\nOr you can come by yourself if you can stand him\nBest believe, I sweat out weaves\nGive Afro Puffs like R.A.G.E\nAww you get if could move it\nBack it on up like a U-Haul truck\nThen run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit\nHe and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music\nHe is to the East coast what Snoop is\nTo the West Coast, what 'Face is to Houston\nYoung Hov' in the house is so necessary\nNo bra with that blouse, that's so necessary\nNo panties and jeans, that's so necessary\nNow why you fronting on me, is that necessary?\nDo I, to you, look like a lame\nWho don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game\nWho's up on dot dot dot and Vera Wang\nMa are you insane? Let's just\n(What you want me to do?)\n\n[Hook: Jay-Z & (Pharrell)]\n(Change clothes, and go)\nYou know I stay fresh to death, a boy from the projects\nAnd I'mma take you to the top of the globe, so let's go\n(So let's exchange numbers and go)\n(And girl I promise you, no substitutes) It's just me\n\n[Interlude: Pharrell & (Jay Z)]\nHa ha!
