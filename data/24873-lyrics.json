'Cause here they come!\n\n[TINA]\nAnd I never wanted\nAnything from you\nExcept everything you had\nAnd what was left after that too\nOh\n\n[MERCEDES, TINA & NEW DIRECTIONS]\nHappiness hit her like a bullet in the back\nStruck from a great height\nBy someone who should know better than that\nThe dog days are over\nThe dog days are done\nCan you hear the horses?\n'Cause here they come\n\n[MERCEDES & TINA]\nRun fast for your mother, run fast for your father\nRun for your children, for your sisters and your brothers\nLeave all your love and your longing behind\nYou can't carry it with you, if you want to survive\n\n[MERCEDES & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]\nThe dog days are over\nThe dog days are done\nCan you hear the horses?\n'Cause here they come!\n\n[NEW DIRECTIONS (MERCEDES, TINA & NEW DIRECTIONS)]\nThe dog days are over\nThe dog days are done (Here they come!)\nThe horses are comin', so you'd better run (Here they come!)\nThe dog days and over\nThe dog days are done (Here they come!)\nThe horses are comin', so you'd better run"}
