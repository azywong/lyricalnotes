Oh.. How could you be so heartless\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo\nJust remember that you talkin' to me though\nYou know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know\nI mean after all the things that we've been through\nI mean after all the things we got into\nHey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me\nHey yo, I did some things but that's the old me\nAnd now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me\nSo you walk around like you don't know me\nYou got a new friend, well i got homies\nBut in the end it's still so lonely\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told\nSomewhere far along this road, he lost his soul\nTo a woman so heartless...\nHow could you be so heartless? Oh... How could you be so heartless\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out the side of me that I dont know..\nI decided we weren't goin' speak so\nWhy we up 3 A.M. on the phone\nWhy does she be so mad at me fo'\nHomie I don't know, she's hot and cold\nI won't stop, I won't mess my groove up cause I already know how this thing go\nYou run and tell your friends that you leavin' me\nThey say that they don't see what you see in me\nYou wait a couple months then you gon' see\nYou'll never find nobody better than me\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told\nSomewhere far along this road, he lost his soul\nTo a woman so heartless..\nHow could you be so heartless? Oh.. How could you be so heartless\n\n[Verse 3]\nTalkin', talkin', talkin', talk\nBaby lets just knock it off\nThey don't know what we been through\nThey don't know 'bout me and you\nSo i got something new to see\nAnd you just gon' keep hatin' me\nAnd we just gon' be enemies\nI know you can't believe\nI could just leave it wrong\nAnd you can't make it right\nI'm gon' take off tonight\nInto the night..\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told\nSomewhere far along this road, he lost his soul\nTo a woman so heartless..\nHow could you be so heartless? Oh.. How could you be so heartless"}
