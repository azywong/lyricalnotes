Holiday..) \n\nSometimes the system goes on the blink \nAnd the whole thing turns out wrong \nYou might not make it back and you know \nThat you could be well oh that strong \nAnd I'm not wrong \n\nSo where is the passion when you need it the most \nOh you and I \nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost \n\nCause you had a bad day \nYou're taking one down \nYou sing a sad song just to turn it around \nYou say you don't know \nYou tell me don't lie \nYou work at a smile and you go for a ride \nYou had a bad day \nYou've seen what you like \nAnd how does it feel for one more time \nYou had a bad day \nYou had a bad day"}
