Oh Oh.. \n\nI don't wanna go another day \nSo I'm telling you, exactly what is on my mind \nSeems like everybody is breaking up \nand throwing their love away \nBut I know I got a good thing right here\n\nThat's why I say (Hey) \n\nNobody gonna love me better, I must stick with you forever \nNobody gonna take me higher, I must stick with you \nYou know how to appreciate me, I must stick with you, my baby \nNobody ever made me feel this way, I must stick with you \n\nI don't wanna go another day \nSo I'm telling you, exactly what is on my mind \nSee the way we ride, in our private lives \nAin't nobody gettin' in between \nI want you to know that, your the only one for me \n\nNobody gonna love me better, I must stick with you forever \nNobody gonna take me higher, I must stick with you \nYou know how to appreciate me, I must stick with you my baby \nNobody ever made me feel this way, I must stick with you \n\nAnd now, ain't nothing else I can need \nAnd now, I'm singing.. 'cause your so, so into me \nI got you, we'll be making love endlessly \nI'm with you, baby you're with me \n\nSo don't cha worry about \npeople hanging around \nthey ain't bring us down \nI know you, and you know me \nand that's all that counts \nSo don't cha worry about \npeople hanging around \nthey ain't bring us down \nI know you, and you know me \nand that's, that's why I say \n\nNobody gonna love me better, I must stick with you forever \nNobody gonna take me higher, I must stick with you \nYou know how to appreciate me, I must stick with you my baby \nNobody ever made me feel this way, I must stick with you \n\nNobody gonna love me better, I must stick with you forever \nNobody gonna take me higher, I must stick with you \nYou know how to appreciate me, I must stick with you my baby \nNobody ever made me feel this way, I must stick with you"}
