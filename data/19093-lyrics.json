Are you ready now?\nWhen it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready\nIt's my turn in a minute, gonna put my message in it\n\n5 minutes in the closet with you\n\nHe's in a bunch of movies, really stupid movies\nIt's not entirely his fault, he can't control it all\nI am not afraid. I can hardly wait\nTruth or dare, I don't care. Tell the truth I dare you\n\nWhen it comes around\nWhen it comes around\n\nDo you feel it too, what I feel for you?\nIf it was just us, would you do what I do?\n\nEverybody's watching. Everybody's looking\nShe's such a sucker. He don't want to fuck her\nHe is gonnna kiss me, if he doesn't miss me\nI am ready for it now. Already on the ground\n\n5 minutes in the closet with you\n\nSpin it 'round again\nSpin it 'round again"}
