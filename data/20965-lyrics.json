Too late\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nOh baby now\nI learned from you\n\nI remember cold nights\nTears I thought would never dry\nHow you shattered my world,with your goodbye\nYour goodbye baby\nWould've sold my soul then\nJust to have you back again\nNow you're the last thing on my mind\n\nNow you say you're sorry,and you've changed your ways\nSorry but you changed your ways too late\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nOh baby now\nI learned from you\n\nSo when all you've got are sleepless nights\nWhen those tears are clouding up your eyes\nJust remember it was you who said goodbye\nWho said goodbye\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you"}
