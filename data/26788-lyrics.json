I. A. a habit, Cali was the mission\nCruise through the west-end in my new Benz\nI'm just tryna live life through a new lens\nDriving by the streets I used to walk through\nWhen I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle\n\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell them what you know, what you seen\nHow I roll, how I be on the low\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell your friends about it\nI'm that nigga with the hair\nSinging 'bout popping pills\nfucking bitches, living life so trill\n\nMy cousin said I made it big and it's unusual\nShe tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral\nUsed to roam on Queen\nnow I sing Queen street anthems\nUsed to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon\nI was broken, I was broken, I was so broke\nI used to roam around the town when I was homeless\nMe and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans\nAnd flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix\nNow we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices\nLay them on the fucking table, we got choices\nAnd if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices\nThey told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless\nYeah, that shit is pointless\nThey told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless\nYeah, that shit is pointless\nIt's only meant to fall in love\nThat shit is pointless\n\nGo tell your friends about it (about it)\nGo tell your friends about it (about it)\nGo tell them what you know, what you seen\nHow I roll, how I be off that coke\nGo tell your friends about it (about it)\nGo tell your friends about it\nI'm that nigga with the hair\nSinging 'bout popping pills\nfucking bitches, living life so trill\nLife so trill\nLife so trill\nLife so trill"}
