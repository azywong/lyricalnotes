No\nDidn't she mind? I don't think so\nWas it for real? Damn sure?\nWhat was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24\nSo was she keen? She couldn't wait\nCinnamon queen? Let me update\nWhat did she say? She said she'd love to\nRendezvous\nShe asked me what we were gonna do\nSaid we'd start with a bottle of moet for \ntwo \n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd On Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday \n\nNine was the time\nCos I'll be getting mine\nAnd she was looking fine\nSmooth talker she told me\nShe'd love to unfold me all night long\nOoh I loved the way she kicked it\nFrom the front to back she flipped\n(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)\nAnd I oh I yeah\nHope that she'd care\nCos I'm a man who'll always be there \n\nOoh yeah\nI'm not a man to play around baby\nOoh yeah\nCos a one night stand isn't really fair\nFrom the first impression girl hmm \nYou don't seem to be like that\nCos there's no need to chat \nFor there'll be plenty of time for that\nFrom the subway to my home\nEndless ringing of my phone\nWhen you're feeling all alone\nAll you gotta do\nIs just call me call me \n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd On Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday \n\n(Break it down, break it down)\nSince I met this special lady\nI can't get her off my mind\nShe's one of a kind\nAnd I ain't about to deny it\nIt's a special kind of thing\nWith you, oh... \n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd On Thursday and Friday and Saturday\nWe chilled on Sunday"}
