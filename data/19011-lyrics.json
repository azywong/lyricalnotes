Hawkins","spotify_id":"0YLhqzktKd1PyF8q2wXED7","lyrics":"I'm dancing in the shadows of life\nAnd death is all around me tonight\nI miss you making love to me right\nBeside myself I'm holding you tight\nSomeone is waiting for me to rise\nAnd dive into the ocean I cried\nAnd I cried and I cried my baby to sleep\nBeside myself my soul to keep\n\nRight beside you I see\nRight beside you I stay\nRight beside you I'll be\nRight beside you always\n\nWe're dancing in the shade of the summer sun\nThe drums are playing\nThe change to come was yesterday\nIn the heat beside myself I need to keep\n\nRight beside you I feel\nRight beside you I am\nRight beside you I kneel\nRight beside you I stand\nRight beside you I see\nRight beside you I stay\nRight beside you I'll be\nRight beside you always\n\nDriving into town with the top down\nSun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed\nOne hand on the wheel one hand on my knee\nI can tell you what I want you can do what you need\nDarling nights are getting cooler in the city so close\nThere's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast\nWe'll arrive on time just a little bit late\nIt's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste\n\nI remember when I was your child\nYou made me up to be your lover\nNow I'm standing right beside you\nOther people still exsist\nI don't pretend to love them less but darling\nWhen you drive this way I lose my breath\n\nRight beside you I feel\nRight beside you I am\nRight beside you I kneel\nRight beside you I stand\nRight beside you I see\nRight beside you I stay\nRight beside you I'll be\nAlways\n\nRight beside you I feel\nRight beside you I am\nRight beside you I kneel\nRight beside you I stand\nRight beside you I see\nRight beside you I stay\nRight beside you I'll be\nRight beside you always"}
