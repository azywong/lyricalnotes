Why must we wait until tonight?\nTell me why? Why must we wait until tonight?\n\nYou wanna take a little time\nWanna drink me like a fine wine\nWrite the book of love line by line\nBut I want to play with you, ooh...mmmm...right now\nGo all the way with you,baby...and show you how\n'Cause my body just can't say no\nAnd fingers just won't let go\n\nTell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah\nTell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?\nYou're touching me, I'm touching you...\nOooh, what should I do? Now tell me why, why must we wait 'till tonight?\n\nYou like to take it real slow\nShow me every little move you know\nTake a little love and watch it grow\nBut I want to lay with you...darling\nRight now\nMake love all day with you baby\nAnd show you how...\nTake my body, don't take my time\nTake your lips and make them mine\nAaaaw\n\nTell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah\nTell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?\nYou're touching me, I'm touching you...\nOooh, what should I do? Now tell me why, why must we wait 'till tonight?\n\nCome on\nCome on\n\n'Cause my body just can't say \"no\"\nAnd my fingers just won't let go\n\nBaby!\nOh tell me why?\nWhy must we wait until tonight\nTell me baby...yeah\nTell me why, when I've waited all my life - like you know I did\nCome on, tell me why...why must we wait until tonight? Come on. Come on\nOhh.Tell me why, why when I've waited all my life. Tell me why"}
