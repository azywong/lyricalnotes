Where was my heart?\nNow I cry alone in the dark\nI lie awake, I drive myself crazy\nDrive myself crazy thinking of you\nMade a mistake when I let you go baby\nI drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do\n(Wanting you the way that I do)\nI was such a fool, I couldn't see it\nJust how good you were to me\n(Just how good you were to me)\nYou confessed your love\n(You confessed your love)\nUndying devotion\nI confessed my need to be free\nAnd now I'm left with all this pain\nI've only got myself to blame, no\nI lie awake I drive myself crazy\nDrive myself crazy thinking of you\nMade a mistake when I let you go baby\nI drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do\n(Wanting you the way that I do)\nWhy didn't I know it?\n(How much I loved you baby)\nWhy couldn't I show it?\n(If I had only told you)\nWhen I had the chance\nOh, I had the chance\nI drive myself crazy\nOh so crazy\nI lie awake I drive myself crazy\nDrive myself crazy thinking of you\nMade a mistake let you go baby\n(Made a mistake)\nI drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do\nI lie awake I drive myself crazy\n(I drive myself)\nDrive myself crazy\n(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy yeah!)\nMade a mistake let you go baby\n(Made a mistake)\nI drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do\nI drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do"}
