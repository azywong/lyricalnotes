What went on?\nWhat went on last night?\nYou look so sweet while you're dreaming (yeah)\nHolding your bottle of Tanqueray (yeah)\nIt isn't even the weekend\nBaby, that's how I know you're the one for me\nI wanna party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party, and party\nCause when the sun sets baby\nOn the avenue\nI get that drunk sex feeling\nYeah, when I'm with you\nSo put your arms around me, baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nWe got that sweet, hot loving\nDancing in the dark\nOut in the streets we're running\nShut down every bar\nSo put your arms around me, baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHungover, I think I'm broken\nYou said the fix is a shot of Jack\nI said, \"Man, what are you smoking?\"\nBut alright, pour a glass, and we'll throw 'em back\nI wanna party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party, and party\nCause when the sun sets baby\nOn the avenue\nI get that drunk sex feeling\nYeah when I'm with you\nSo put your arms around me baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nWe got that sweet, hot loving\nDancing in the dark\nOut in the streets we're running\nShut down every bar\nSo put your arms around me, baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party, and party\nI wanna party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party, and party\nCause when the sun sets baby\nOn the avenue\nI get that drunk sex feeling\nYeah when I'm with you\nSo put your arms around me baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nWe got that sweet hot loving\nDancing in the dark\nOut in the streets we're running\nShut down every bar\nSo put your arms around me baby\nWe're tearing up the town\nCause that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nHow we do, that's just how we do\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\nAnd party and party"}
