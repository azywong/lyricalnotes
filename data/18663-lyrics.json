{"song_name":"World (The Price Of Love)","artist_id":312182,"display_artist":"New Order","spotify_id":"null","lyrics":"I turn sideways to the sun\nKeep my thoughts from everyone\nIt's a jungle, I'm a freak\nHear me talk, but never speak\n\nSo I'm stepping out of time\nBecause breaking is a crime\nAnd it may all be too late\nBut I've no passion for this hate\n\nThat's the price of love (that's the price of love)\nCan you feel it? (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now (that's the price of love)\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\n\nAnd when this building is on fire\nThese flames can't burn any higher\nI turn sideways to the Sun\nAnd in a moment I am gone\n\nThat's the price of love (that's the price of love)\nCan you feel it? (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now (that's the price of love)\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\nThat's the price of love (that's the price of love)\nCan you feel it? (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now (that's the price of love)\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\n\nThat's the price of love (that's the price of love)\nCan you feel it? (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now (that's the price of love)\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\n(That's the price of love)\nThat's the price of love (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now (that's the price of love)\nHow long will it last? (that's the price of love)\n(That's the price of love)\nThat's the price of love (can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now\nHow long will it last?\n(That's the price of love)\n(Can you feel it?)\nIf we could buy it now\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\nIf we could buy it now\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\nIf we could buy it now\nHow long would it last? (that's the price of love)\nIf we could buy it now\nHow long would it last?"}
