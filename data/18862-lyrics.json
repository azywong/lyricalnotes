Move from the gate now!\n\n[Hook: Method Man]\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]\nIt's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'\nSurvival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival\nI peep at the shape of the streets\nAnd stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep\nA man with a dream with plans to make cream\nWhich failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen\nA young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much\nTryin' to get a clutch at what I could not\nThe court played me short, now I face incarceration\nPacin', goin' upstate's my destination\nHandcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us\nLife as a shorty shouldn't be so rough\nBut as the world turned I learned life is hell\nLivin' in the world no different from a cell\nEvery day I escape from Jakes givin' chase\nSellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase\nThough I don't know why I chose to smoke sess\nI guess that's the time when I'm not depressed\nBut I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?\nReady to give up so I seek the old Earth\nWho explained workin' hard may help you maintain\nTo learn to overcome the heartaches and pain\nWe got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks\nAnd stray shots, all on the block that stays hot\nLeave it up to me while I be livin' proof\nTo kick the truth to the young black youth\nBut shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer\nAnd ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear\nNeglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted\nThat what? That life is hectic\n\n[Hook: Method Man]\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\n\n[Outro: Inspectah Deck]\nNiggas got to do what they got to do\nTo get through, know what I'm sayin'?\nBecause you can't just get by no more\nWord up, you gotta get over, straight up and down\n\n[Hook: Method Man]\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all"}
