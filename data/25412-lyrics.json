Why?\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy, why\n\nMercedes:\nDoes he do me that way?\nIf they say\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nWhy? Why?\nTell 'em that it's human nature\n\nSam:\nWhy? (Mercedes: Why?) Why?\n\nMercedes:\nDoes he do me that way, yeah\n\nSam:\nReaching out\nTo touch a stranger\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nElectric eyes are everywhere (Mercedes: Ooh)\n\nSam:\nSee that girl?\nShe knows I'm watching\nShe likes the way I stare\n\nMercedes:\nIf they say\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nWhy? Why?\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? Oh, why?\nDoes he do me that way?\n\nMercedes:\nIf they say\n\nSam:\nWhy? (Mercedes: Why?) Why?\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nTell 'em that it's human nature\n\nSam:\nWhy? (Mercedes: Why?) Oh, why?\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nDoes he do me that way?\n\nMercedes:\nI like livin' this way\n\nSam:\nI like lovin' this way\n\nMercedes:\nOh, why, oh, why\nOh, why, oh, why\n\nLooking out\nAcross the morning\nWhere the city's heart begins to beat\nReaching out\nI touch his shoulder\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nI'm dreaming of the street\n\nMercedes:\nAnd they say\n\nSam:\nWhy? (Mercedes: Why?) Why? (Mercedes: Why, why, why, why)\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nTell 'em hat it's human nature\nWhy? Why?\nDoes he do me that way?\n\nSam:\nWhy? (Mercedes: Dooby-doo-why) Why? (Mercedes: Dooby-doo-why, ooh)\nTell 'em that (with Mercedes: it's human nature)\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nWhy?\n\nSam:\nWhy?\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nDoes he do me that way?\n\nMercedes:\nI like livin' this way\n\nSam:\nI like lovin' this way\n\nMercedes:\nOh, why, oh, why\nOh, why, oh, why\n\nMercedes and Sam:\nWhy? Why?\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy?"}
