Roll out!\n\n[Chorus - \"roll out!\" in background]\nI got my twin glock .40s, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\nTwin glock .40s, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nNow where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?\nWhere'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted?\nWho them girls you be with when you be ridin through?\nMan I ain't got nothin to prove, I paid my dues\nBreakin the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a cruise\nTell me who's your weed man, how do you smoke so good?\nYou's a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?\nWhat in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?\nA couple a cans a whoop ass, you did a good ass job of just eyein me, spyin me\n\n[Chorus]\n\nMan, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?\nThat's eighty-thousand bucks GONE, where in the fuck did you spend it?\nYou must have eyes on your back, 'cause you got money to the ceiling\nAnd the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin\nThe better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin\nWinnin, drillin and killin the feelin\nNow who's that bucked-naked cook fixin three-course meals?\nGettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels\nWhat in the world is in that ROOM, what you got in that ROOM?\nA couple a gats, a couple a knives, a couple of rats, a couple of wives\nNow it's time to choose\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAre you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?\nPlaystation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?\nIs that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?\nYou take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips, touchin lips to the top of the dick\nNow tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?\nWhat about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?\nWhat in the world is in that CASE, what you got in that CASE?\nGet up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace\nSo shake, shake it\n\n[(Chorus) 1/2x]\n\nGet out my business, my biznass\nStay the fuck up out my biznass, ah\n'Cause these bitches all up in my shit and it's my business,\nmy biznass\nStay the fuck up out my biznass, 'cause it's mine, oh mine\nMy business, my biznass\nStay the fuck up out my biznass\n'Cause these niggers all up in my shit.......[fade]\n"}
