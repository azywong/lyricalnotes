Hell no\nBut she chose to be with him, shorty \n\nTell me is the money worth your soul\nTell me what's the reason that you hold on \nWhen you know that dude has a whole wall of 'em just\nlike you\nAnd girl you're just way too fine \nGotta be treated as one of a kind\nGirl use your mind\nDon't be just another dime\n\nBecause \n\nI can't take\nSeeing you with him\n'Cuz I know exactly what you'll be,\nIn his gallery\nIt's just not fair\nAnd it's tearing me apart\nYou're just another priceless work of art\nIn his gallery\n\nShe's so confused\nShe knows she deserves more\nSomeone who will love and adore\nBut his money's hard to ignore\nShe really doesn't know what to do\nGirl it's just a matter of time\nBefore he finds another more fine\nAfter he's done dulling your shine\nYou're out the door and he's through with you\n\nTell me is the money worth your soul\nTell me what's the reason that you hold on, \nWhen you know that dude has a whole wall of 'em just\nlike you\nAnd girl you're just way too fine \nGotta be treated as one of a kind\nGirl use your mind\nDon't be just another dime\n\nI can't take\nSeeing you with him\n'Cuz I know exactly what you'll be\nIn his gallery\nIt's just not fair\nAnd it's tearing me apart\nYou're just another priceless work of art\nIn his gallery\n\nYou're a masterpiece\nI know that he\nCan't appreciate your beauty\nDon't let him cheapen you\nHe don't see you like i do\nBeautiful not just for show\nTime that someone let you know\n\nI can't take\nSeeing you with him\n'Cuz I know exactly what you'll be\nIn his gallery\nIt's just not fair\nAnd it's tearing me apart\nYou're just another priceless work of art\n\nI can't take\nSeeing you with him\n'Cuz I know exactly what you'll be\nIn his gallery\nIt's just not fair\nAnd it's tearing me apart\nYou're just another priceless work of art\nIn his gallery\nIn his gallery"}
