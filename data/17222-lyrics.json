Well, alright\nYou think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild\nShoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile\nHoney but you met your match tonight, oh, that's right\nYou think you'll knock me off my feet 'till I'm flat on the floor\n'Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more\nSo come on, baby, come on, baby\nCome on, baby, show me what that loaded gun is for\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you can give it, I can take it\n'Cause if this heart is gonna break\nIt's gonna take a lot to break it\n'Cause I know tonight\nSomebody's gonna win the fight\nSo if you're so tough\nCome on and prove it\nYour heart is down for the count\nAnd you know you're gonna lose it\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide\nWell, you ain't so strong\nWon't be long 'till your hands are tied\nTonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive, that's right\nYou break the laws of love in the name of desire\nTake ten steps back, c'ause I'm ready, baby, aim and fire\nBaby, there's no way you're gonna run tonight\nOoh, that's right\nWell, you've had your way with love\nBut it's the end of the day\nNow a team of wild horses couldn't break your heart away\nSo come on, baby, come on, baby\nCome on, baby, you know there ain't nothing left to say\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you can give it, I can take it\n'Cause if this heart is gonna break\nIt's gonna take a lot to break it\nI know tonight\nSomebody's gonna win the fight\nSo if you're so tough\nCome on and prove it\nYour heart is down for the count\nAnd you know you're gonna lose it\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James\n\n[Bridge]\nYou think you'll knock me off my feet\n'Til I'm flat on the floor\n'Til my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more\nSo come on, baby, come on, baby\nCome on, baby, come on\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you can give it, I can take it\n'Cause if this heart is gonna break\nIt's gonna take a lot to break it\nI know tonight\nSomebody's gonna win the fight\nSo if you're so tough\nCome on and prove it\nYour heart is down for the count\nAnd you know you're gonna lose it\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James\nI'm gonna shoot you down, Jesse James"}
