Oh no, 'Goodbye.'\r\nBut you got me like a rocket shootin' straight across the sky.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me,\r\nIt's a feelin' like this.\r\nIt's centrifugal motion,\r\nit's perpetual bliss.\r\nIt's that pivotal moment.\r\nIt's 'Ah, impossible.'\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\nUnstoppable.\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\n\r\nBOO!!!\r\n\r\nCinderella said to Snow White\r\n'How does love get so off course?\r\nOh, all I wanted was a white knight with a good heart,\r\nsoft touch, fast horse.'\r\nRide me off into the sunset, baby I'm forever yours.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me,\r\nit's a feelin' like this.\r\nIt's centrifugal motion,\r\nit's perpetual bliss.\r\nIt's that pivotal moment.\r\nIt's 'Ah, unthinkable.'\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\nUnsinkable.\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\n\r\nYou can kiss me in the moonlight on a rooftop under the sky.\r\nOh, you can kiss me with the windows open while the rain comes pouring inside.\r\nOh, kiss me in sweet slow motion,\r\nlet's let everything slide.\r\nYou've got me floating, you've got me flying.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me,\r\nit's a feelin' like this.\r\nIt's centrifugal motion,\r\nit's perpetual bliss.\r\nIt's that pivotal moment.\r\nIt's 'Ah, subliminal.'\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\nIt's criminal.\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me baby,\r\nit's the way you love me darling, yeah.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me,\r\nit's a feelin' like this.\r\nIt's centripetal motion,\r\nit's perpetual bliss.\r\nIt's that pivotal moment.\r\nIt's 'Ah, subliminal.'\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\nIt's criminal.\r\nThis kiss, this kiss.\r\n\r\nIt's the way you love me baby,\r\nit's the way you love me darling, yeah.\r\n\r\n(Fade)"}
