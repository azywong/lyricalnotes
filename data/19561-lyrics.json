Who are you, but I like it\nNow I'm done with nothing new, sometimes green sometimes blue\nAnd I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty\nAnd you're guilty too\nHey Hey Hey I'm guilty and you're guilty too\nHey Hey Hey Hey\nI'll tell you something, something new\nYou're hearing nothing, nothing true\nYou're killing me, I'm killing you\nAnd I'm guilty too\nOne two three, I found you out so easily\nOne two three, I found in you what I found in me\nThe time is wrong, the time is right--be careful who you kill tonight\nAnd I'm melting, and I'm melting, and I'm melting, and I'm melting\nAnd I'm melting in you\nHey Hey Hey I'm guilty and you're guilty too\nHey Hey Hey Hey\nOne and one and one makes three\nOne and one why don't you see\nI'm killing you, you're killing me\nCan't you set me free\nInside out, I can't describe it, what you do to me\nInside out, I cannot hide it looking right through me\nNow I've reached the living end, pointing fingers to defend\nAnd I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty\nAnd you're guilty too\nI'll tell you something, something new\nYou're hearing nothing, nothing true\nYou're killing me, I'm killing you\nAnd I'm guilty too \n"}
