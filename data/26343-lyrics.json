[x2]\n\nWell, you hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet\nBurn me up and down, no where to cool it\n\nEvery time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey\n\nYou hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet\nBurned me up and down, no way to cool it\nBut every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey\nIt's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head\nOne shot, two shot, copper tone red\nEvery time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey\n\nEvery time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
