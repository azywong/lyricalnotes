You try to tell me that I'm clever,\nbut that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you.\n\nYou said that I was naive,\nand I thought that I was strong.\nI thought, \"hey, I can leave, I can leave.\"\nOh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you.\nYeah, I missed you.\n\nYou said you caught me cuz u want me and one day you'll let me go.\n\"You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose.\nAnd you say, \"Stay.\"\n\nAnd you say I only hear what I want to.\n"}
