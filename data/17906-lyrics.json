He's got power brakes\nHe's got a power bed. Push a button and it shakes\nHe's got no one to talk to and tears rolling down his face\nHe's ain't got the power of love...\n\nLouis drives a beat up '69 Dart\nSwares it's the statue of Mary that keeps the car from falling apart\nWith Gracie right beside him sittin' closer than a smile\nShe's got her head on his shoulder\nHe loves to drive and hold her\n\nHe got no power windows. Got no power brakes\nHe ain't got no power nothin' but he got what it takes\nHe's got Gracie's arm around him and a smile on his face\nHe's got the power of love\n\nNo air condition'...no cellular telephone\nHe goes rumblin' down the highway listenin' to his A.M. radio\nWith one arm out the window and a smile on his face\nMakes you wonder how he got there 'til you see him look at Grace...\n\nNo power windows...got no power brakes..\nHe ain't got no power nothin' but he got what it takes...\nOne arm out the window and a smile upon his face...\nIt makes you wonder how he got there until you see hime look at Grace...\nSee him look at grace\n\nHe got the power... ain't that the power of love\nHe's got the power...ain't that the power of love\nHe's got the power...ain't that the power of love\nHe's got the poer...ain't that the...he got no\nPower windows...got no power brakes\nHe ain't got no power nothing but he got what it takes...\nPower of love...the power of love...he got the power...the power of love"}
