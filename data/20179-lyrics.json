Woah!\nHigh! Wide! Oh...\nHe floated back down 'cause he wanted to share\nHis key to the locks on the chains \nhe saw everywhere\nBut first he was stripped, \nand then he was stabbed\nBy faceless men, well... He still stands.\nAnd he still gives his love, he just gives it away\nThe love he receives is the love that is saved\nAnd sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky\nA human being that was given to fly\n\nFlying! Woah...\nWhole! Flying! Woah...\nFlying woah...\nOh woah..."}
