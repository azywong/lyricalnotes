Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin\nI'm entertainin, my number one fan\nMy back is achin, from our love makin\nOh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin\nMy ups, my downs, my high and my lows\nFrom head to toe, he makes me glow\nHe hits the spot, he makes me hot\nI'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Rakim]\nThinking of a master plan\nYou know anything you need baby ask your man\nYou was there from a half a gram\nNow it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands\nWe ball like we own the world\nThe only concern is you my only girl\nAnd when we speakin in tongues\nBreathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs\nKeep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done\nIt's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game\nIt's fucked up, but you never complain\nYou just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood\nJust another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good\nNo more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts\nGettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out\nJust me and you, high off sex and twisted\nYou OG'd and you OD: addicted"}
