Will you never call again? \nAnd will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face? \nAnd will you never try to reach me? \nIt is I that wanted space \n\nHate me today \nHate me tomorrow \nHate me for all the things I didn't do for you\n\nHate me in ways \nYeah ways hard to swallow \nHate me so you can finally see what's good for you \n\nI'm sober now for 3 whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with \nThe one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again \nIn a sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night \nWhile I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight \nYou never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate \nYou made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take \nSo I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind \nAnd do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind \n\nHate me today \nHate me tomorrow \nHate me for all the things I didn't do for you \n\nHate me in ways \nYeah ways hard to swallow \nHate me so you can finally see what's good for you \n\nAnd with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave \nKicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made \nAnd like a baby boy I never was a man \nUntil I saw your blue eyes crying and I held your face in my hand \nAnd then I fell down yelling \"make it go away!\" \nJust make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be \nAnd then she whispered \"How can you do this to me?\" \n\nHate me today \nHate me tomorrow \nHate me for all the things I didn't do for you \n\nHate me in ways \nYeah ways hard to swallow \nHate me so you can finally see what's good for you"}
