Ooh...\n\nTalkin' to you on the phone\nI like the way you talk to me\nAnd that little girly voice\nI've gotten to know you\nAnd you might be sublime\nI've always wanted a girl like you\nDarling, that's no lie\n\nLove me for life\nOh, I wish that you'd be mine\nAnd only mine\nIt feels so right\nAnd won't you tell me right now\nWill you be my girl\n\nOoh...\nLa de la de la\nLa de la de la\nWhoa, whoa...\n\nThese last few days have been\nBeautiful and bright\nI want you to be part of my life\nIt work out fine\nNever imagined\nThat you would feel for me\n'Cause I thought that I was the only one\nWho fell this way\n\nLove me for life\nOh, I wish that you'd be mine\nAnd only mine\nIt feels so right\nAnd won't you tell me right now\nWill you be my girl\n\nTell me who's gonna my day seem brighter\nIf you're gone, if you're gone\n\nLove me for life\nOh, I wish that you'll be my lady, my lady\nI love you, girl\nIt feels so right\nAnd won't you tell me right now\nWill you be my girl"}
