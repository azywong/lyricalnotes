Puff Daddy, Black Rob)\n\n[Puffy]\nI see clearly now\nBad Boy, ready\nDream\nWe rock the beat\nAnd we rock the beat\nI see clearly now\nAnd we rock the beat\n26, Bad Boy baby\nRemix\n\n[Dream]\nPullin' petals off a flower, tryna get your way\nKeep pullin' 'til it tells what you wanna say\nGirl you can pick a field full of daisies\nBut he'd still be my baby\n\nI know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him\nInstinctively, I know what you're thinking\nYou'll be giving him an open invitation\nBut my baby won't be takin' it, no\n\n[1] - You can pout your cherry lips\nTry to tempt him with a sweet kiss\nYou can flirt your pretty eyes\nCuz he ain't got his hands tied\n\n[2] - No chains to unlock\nSo free to do what he wants\nHe's into what he's got\nHe loves me, he loves you not\n\nNo matter what you do\nHe's never gonna be with you\nHe's into what he's got\nHe loves me, he loves you not\n\n[Puffy]\nI can see clearly now\n\n[Dream]\nYou're the kind of girl that's always up for do or dare\nOnly want him because he's there\nAlways lookin' for a new ride\nThe grass is greener on the other side\n\nYou're the kind of girl who's not used to hearin' no\nAll your lovers try to take you where you wanna go\nDoesn't matter how hard you try\nYou're never gonna get with my guy\n\n[Repeat 1]\n[Repeat 2]\n\n[Black Rob] [Puffy]\nYo, yo, I wake up in the morning for the breakfast in bed (uh huh)\nAnd wind up with the breakfast and head\nYou fire hot, you get the Lexus in red (uh huh)\nBut you know I'm ghetto like ?Christians and bread? (a week)\nTradin' the moon and the sun (yeah)\nFor hard work and fun (that's right)\nYou know it ain't no rest\nAnd why you stressin' me, huh (why you stressin' me, huh)\nI love you like Kung Fu and new ones\nDon't worry about Susan, cuz you the one (you the one)\nI make that spinach somewhere in Venice (bounce)\nI don't mean to ignore you, I put you in the fence (come on)\nI ain't got time for hotlines\nProbably a hot nine, you think and I find (take it, heh)\nOh contrare, I won't flare\nCatch me on Con Air, causin' a bomb scare\nSo much cream, my thumb green\nA million scene reminds me of a dream\n\n[Repeat 2 to fade (with Puffy ad-libing)]"}
