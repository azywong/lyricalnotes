Oh, you fancy huh?\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nYou—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh?\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nYou getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile\nIn the bathroom flat irons and nail files\nSpending hours in salons on your hairstyles\nIn the mall steady racking up the air miles\nHit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number\nYou say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer\nAnd you don’t do it for the man, men never notice\nYou just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest\nIntelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart\nI’ve always liked my women book and street smart\nLong as they got a little class like half days\nAnd the confidence to overlook my past ways\nTime heals all and heels hurt to walk in\nBut they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in\nAnd look, I really think that nobody does it better\nI love the way you put it together\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nYou—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh?\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nWell, aren’t you a breath of fresh air?\nFrom all these superficial gold digging bitches in here\nThey get a baller, think that they ain't got to pick a career\nGuess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear\nLike \"voilà!\" You do it right he might just buy you a car\nNow she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar\nNow here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar\nI say I’m buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre\nIndependent with the demeanor of an R&B singer\nNaked ring finger, M3 Beamer\nChampagne Range, Triple white Jag\nCloset full of brand new clothes and handbags\nAlexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel\nD&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe\nYou ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's\nWho fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nYou—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh?\n\n[Interlude: Drake & Swizz Beatz]\nAtlanta girls, let me see your hands\nWave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends\nGirl you got it, let 'em know that everything big\nNails done hair done, everything big\nAnd my NY girls, let me see your hands\nWave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends\nGirl you got it, let 'em know that everything big\nNails done hair done, everything big\nAnd my LA girls, let me see your hands\nWave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends\nGirl you got it, let 'em know everything big\nNails done hair done, everything big\nAnd my TO girls, let me see your hands\nWave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends\nGirl you got it, let 'em know everything big\nNails done, hair done—nails done, hair done\nSay go Cinderella, go Cinderella\nOrgasm blush, lipstick and concealer\nDevil in a tight dress, girl you a killer\nAnd ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go\nGo, go, go, go, go, go, go (show time)\nGo, go, go, go, go (as we proceed)\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nUh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook\nCinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot\nAnd when I find it is when I find you\nAnd we can do the things we never got the time to\nBetter late than never but never late is better\nThey tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together\nI’m down for whatever, you just lead the way\nWe go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay\nMature women with more than me were the first to tempt me\nAnd Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley\nHow she got it I ain't never get to ask\nI just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash\nYeah, but shout out to the homeowners\nThe girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us\nA little something extra, should we ever need it\nIf it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?\nYou—you fancy huh?
