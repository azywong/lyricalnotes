He keeps grinnin\nBout you and whistilin tunes, while he ought to be watchin, we move alike and\nWe loo the same but I swear we've got totally different brains and the love\nWe're in with you, just makes it clear, he used to be my win, now there's a\nStranger in my mirror. And he doesn't want to go out drinkin with all of his\nFriends no more, he's got both of thinkin, you're what we; re livin for. We've\nGone crazy and we can't recover. You're always on one mind or the other. I\nAdmit we should be certified. He's a little schizophrenic and so am I, there's\nA stranger in my mirror, who don't know how to be have, he keeps grinnin bout\nYou and whistlin tunes. While he ought to be watchin me shave, we move alike\nAnd we loo the same but I swear we've got totally different brains and the love\nWe're in with you, just makes it clear, he used to be my win, now there's a\nStranger in my mirror\nAnd he's always doin little things I never thought I'd do, like lookin at\nDiamond rings, drwin hearts and writin I love you's. Thought it was just a case\nOf mild affection, until I cought a glimpse of my reflection. I looked up into\nMy own eyes. And saw someone startin back I didn't recognize\nThere's a stranger in my mirror, who don't know how to behave. He keeps grinnin\nBout you and whistilin tunes, while he ought to be watchin, we move alike and\nWe loo the same but I swear we've got totally different brains and the love\nWe're in with you, just makes it clear, he used to be my win, now there's a\nStranger in my mirror. Lord I'm in love with you and there's a stranger in my\nMirror"}
