What if you walk?\nWhat if you rock around the clock?\nTick-tock. Tick-tock.\nWhat if you did? What if you walk?\nWhat if you tried to get off, baby?\n\nHey, kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby.\n\nHey kids, shake a leg.\nMaybe you're crazy in the head, baby.\n\nMaybe you did. Maybe you walked.\nMaybe you rocked around the clock.\nTick-tock. Tick-tock.\nMaybe I ride. Maybe you walk.\nMaybe I drive to get off, baby.\n\nHey kids, shake a leg.\nMaybe you're crazy in the head, baby.\n\nOllie, ollie.\nOllie ollie ollie.\nOllie ollie in come free, baby.\n\nHey, kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby.\n\nSmack, crack. Shack-a-lack.\nTie another one to your back, baby.\n\nHey kids, rock and roll.\nNobody tells you where to go, baby.\n\nMaybe you did. Maybe you walk.\nMaybe you rock around the clock\nTick-tock. Tick-tock.\nMaybe I ride. Maybe you walk.\nMaybe I drive to get off, baby.\n\nHey kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby.\n\nHey kids, rock and roll.\nNobody tells you where to go, baby, baby, baby.\n"}
