(Oh)\nDon't wanna give in, so we both gave up\nCan't take it back, it's too late\nWe've reached the climax (climax)\n\nI've fallen somehow, feet off the ground\nLove is the cloud that keeps raining down\nWhere are you now, when I need you around?\nI'm on my knees, but it seems we're...\n\nGoing nowhere fast\nWe've reached our climax\nWe're together, now we're undone\nWon't commit so we choose to run away\nDo we separate? (Oh)\nDon't wanna give in, so we both gave up\nCan't take it back, it's too late\nWe've reached the climax (climax)\n\nI gave my best, it wasn't enough\nYou kept saying we argue too much\nWe made a mess of what used to be love\nSo why do I care, I care at all?\nAt all\nAt all\nAt all\n\nGoing nowhere fast\nWe've reached our climax\nWe're together, now we're undone\nWon't commit so we choose to run away\nDo we separate? (Oh)\nDon't wanna give in, so we both gave up\nCan't take it back, it's too late\nWe've reached the climax (climax)\n\nYou said it's better if we\nLove each other separately\nI just need you one more time\nI can't get what we had off my mind\nWhere are you now when I need you around?\nI'm on my knees, but it seems we're...\n\nGoing nowhere fast\nWe've reached our climax\nWe're together, now we're undone\nWon't commit so we choose to run away\nDo we separate? (Oh)\nDon't wanna give in, so we both gave up\nCan't take it back, it's too late\nWe've reached the climax (climax)"}
