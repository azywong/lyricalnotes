Bang!\n\nIt was a warm night on the south side of town\nThey said they’d seen ya\nYou were sneakin’ around with a stranger,\nGirl these rumors are drivin’ me mad\n\nAll my good friends turn their face to the wall\nWhen they see me, what the hell’s goin’ on am I so blind\nThat I can’t see when I’m being had\n\nI know it’s silly but girl I really thought we had a chance\nI must’ve been crazy!\n\nChorus:\nBang Bang, what’s that sound\nI gave you my love and you shot me down\nBang Bang, you’re so cool\nPlayin’ a game, someday you’re gonna lose\nBang! Bang!\n\nGirl you told me you were not like the rest\nThen you showed me now you’re failing the test\nIt was easy just an urge in the heat of the nite\n\nI believed you, now that’s all in the past\nCause I made some mistakes but I’m learnin’ fast\nNever put your heart on the line!\nNever put your heart on the line!\n\nI know it’s silly but girl I really thought we had a chance\nI must’ve been crazy!"}
