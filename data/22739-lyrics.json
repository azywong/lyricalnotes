Whatcha been doin?\nWhoa, Whoa,\nHaven't seen ya 'round,\n\nHow you been feelin'? How you been feelin'?\nWhoa, whoa\nDon't you bring me down\n\nAll that stuff about me\nBeing with him,\nCan't believe\nAll the lies that you told\nJust to ease your own soul\nBut I'm bigger than that\nNo, you don't have my back\nNo, No\n\nRefrão:\nHey, how long till the music drowns you out?\nDon't put words up in my mouth\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\nHey, how long till you face what's goin' on\nCause you really got it wrong\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\n\nWell, I'm sorry,\nThat he called me,\nAnd that I answered the telephone\nDon't be worried\nI'm not with him\nAnd when I go out tonight\nI'm going home alone\nJust got back from my tour\nI'm a mess girl for sure\nAll I want is some fun\nGuess that I'd better run\nHollywood sucks you in\nBut it won't spit me out\n\nRefrão:\nHey, how long till the music drowns you out?\nDon't put words up in my mouth\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\nHey, how long till you face what's going on?\nCause you really got it wrong\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\nHey, how long till you look at your own life\nInstead of looking into mine\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\nHey, how long till you're leaving me alone?\nDon't you got somewhere to go?\nI didn't steal your boyfriend\n\nWhoa, whoa, ha\nWhoa, whoa, ha\n\nPlease stop telling all your friends\nI'm getting sick of them\nAlways staring at me like I took him from you\n\nRefrão\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, ha\nWhoa, I didn't steal your boyfriend\nWhoa, whoa whoa, ha\nWhoa, I didn't steal your boyfriend"}
