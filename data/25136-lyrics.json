No, no-no-no.\r\n\"No, no. You're not the one for me.\r\n\"No, no. No, no-no-no.\r\n\"No, no. You're not the one for me.\"\r\n\r\n(ooooo, woo-hoo)\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, no.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart had a problem, in the early hours,\r\nSo I stopped it dead for a beat or two.\r\n(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)\r\nBut I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,\r\nAnd it won't forgive me after all these years\r\n(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)\r\n\r\nSo I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere\r\nWith a big black horse and a cherry tree.\r\n(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)\r\nNow It won't come back, cause it's oh so happy\r\nAnd now I've got a hole for the world to see\r\n(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)\r\n\r\nAnd It said, \"No, no, no, no-no-no.\r\n\"No, no, you're not the one for me.\r\n\"No, no, no, no-no-no.\r\n\"No, no, you're not the one for me.\"\r\n\r\n(ooooo, woo-hoo) (not the one for me, yeah-eh)\r\n(ooooo, woo-hoo)\r\nSaid no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no\r\nYou're not the one for me\r\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no\r\nYou're not the one for me\r\n\r\nBig black horse and a cherry tree\r\nI can't quite get there cause they've all forsaken me\r\nBig black horse and a cherry tree\r\nI can't quite get there cause they've all forsaken me"}
