If I could melt your heart \nMmm-mm-mm... We'd never be apart \nMmm-mm-mm... Give yourself to me \nMmm-mm-mm... You hold the key \n  \nNow there's no point in placing the blame \nAnd you should know I suffer the same \nIf I lose you, my heart will be broken \nLove is a bird, she needs to fly \nLet all the hurt inside of you die \nYou're frozen when your heart's not open \n  \nCHORUS \n  \nYou only see what your eyes want to see \nHow can life be what you want it to be \nYou're frozen when your heart's not open \n  \nCHORUS (2x) \n  \nIf I could melt your heart"}
