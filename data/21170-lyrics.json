Just think about it\n\nShe calls out to the man on the street\nHe can see she's been crying\nShe's got blisters on the soles of her feet\nShe can't walk, but she's trying\n\nOh think twice, it's another day for\nYou and me in paradise\nOh think twice, it's just another day for you,\nYou and me in paradise\n\nOh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do\nOh Lord, there must be something you can say\n\nYou can tell from the lines on her face\nYou can see that she's been there\nProbably been moved on from every place\nCause she didn't fit in there\n\nOh think twice, it's another day for\nYou and me in paradise\nOh think twice, it's just another day for you,\nYou and me in paradise\n... Just think about it\n\nThink about it\nJust think about it\nWon't you, won't you please\n\nIt's another day, for you and me in paradise\nIt's just another day for you and me in paradise\nIt's another day for you and me in paradise\nIt's just another day for you and me in paradise\nIn paradise\nIn paradise\nIn paradise\nIn paradise"}
