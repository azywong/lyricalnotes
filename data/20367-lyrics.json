Ohhh\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\nI'm gonna climb right up on top\nAnd take a good look at where I'm going\nAnd it ain't gonna slow me down\nHold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)\nIt's just a stepping\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\nI'm gonna climb right up on top\nAnd take a good look at where I'm going\nAnd it ain't gonna slow me down\nHold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping, stepping stone\nStepping Stone"}
