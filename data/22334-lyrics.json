With you, I fall so fast\nI can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts\n\nOhhhhh\nIt seems like I can finally rest my head \non something real\nI like the way that feels\nOhhhhh\nIt's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself\nI love how you can tell\nAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me\nAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me\n\nI am moody, messy\nI get restless, and it's senseless\nHow you never seem to care\n\nWhen I'm angry, you listen\nMake me happy it's a mission\nAnd you won't stop til I'm there\n\nFall... Sometimes I fall so fast\nWhen I hit that bottom\nCrash, you're all I have\n\nOhhhhh\nIt seems like I can finally rest my head \non something real\nI like the way that feels\nOhhhhh\nIt's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself\nI love how you can tell\nAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me\n\nHow do you know everything I'm about to say?\nAm I that obvious?\nAnd if it's written on my face...\nI hope it never goes away... yeah\n\nOn a Monday, I am waiting\nAnd by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...\nSo I can breathe\n\nOhhhhh\nIt seems like I can finally rest my head \non something real\nI like the way that feels\nOhhhhh\nIt's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself\nI love how you can tell\nOhhhhh\nI love how you can tell\nOhhhhh\nI love how you can tell\nAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me\nAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me..."}
