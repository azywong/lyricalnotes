Here we go again... Here we go again...\n\nOh, oh I want some more oh oh What are you waitin' for?\nTake a bite of my heart tonight.\nOh oh I want some more oh oh What are we waitin' for?\nWhat are we waitin' for? What are we waitin' ...?\nHere we go again... oh oh Here we go again...oh oh\nHere we go again... oh oh\nSay goodbye to my heart tonight...\nOh oh I want some more oh oh What are we waitin' for?\nWhat are we waitin' for?\nSay goodbye to my heart tonight\n\n\n@maneedsyou"}
