And Mike you control the vinyl \nI'll control the stage 'cause I come of, \n\nChorus \n\nFour score and seven years ago \nthere were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know \nFour score and seven years later \nI dig a hole in those rappers like the moon with a crater \nBecause they battle me they're really taking a risk, \nCause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc, \nAnd like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succesion, \nI'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' proffesion \nI'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker, \nand I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snooka, \nLike a shuttle goes up into outer space, people's hands go up when I enter \nthe place, \nI don't mean to brag or boast just to tell ya I'm great, but I can rock the \nmicrophone like Dorothy Hammil can skate, \nYeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Luganis can dive, Don't have to be \nSaturday night for Young MC to get live 'cause I come off, \n\nChorus \n\nYo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off \nYo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go \n\nNow one behold, Young MC struck gold, \nform the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old, \nFrom the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb, \nFrom the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum, \nYou know the other rappers wanna play a game with me, \nthey run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC, \nLike a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be \nso when I start I say Oli Oli Oxenfree, \nYo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one, \nSo pay attention 'cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes \nnobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersy, LA or Philidelphia, \nCity to city, and town to town, place to place \ncountry to country, cause I get around \nEven if you were in prison you'da heard me play \ncause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA, \nSo when you get out come and see my show \nand if you start static back in you go \n'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam, \nand when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn \ncause I come off \n\nChorus \n\nI come off. Yo baby, I come off. Here we go"}
