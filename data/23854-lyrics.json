Suicide\n\nI've already died.\nYou're just the funeral I've been\nwaiting for... Cyanide\nliving dead inside\nBreak this empty shell forever more.\n\nWait, wait patiently\nYour death, black wings\nUnfolding sleep\nSpreading over me\n\nEmpty they say,\nDeath, won't you let me stay?\nEmpty they say,\nDeath, hear me call your name,\nCall your name... Suicide\n\nI've already died.\nYou're just the funeral I've been\nwaiting for... Cyanide\nliving dead inside\nBreak this empty shell forever more.\n\nSay, is that rain or are they tears?\nThat has stained your concrete face for years.\nThe crying, weeping, shedding strife\nYear after year, life after life.\n\nAn air of freshly broken ground.\nA concrete angel lit right down\nUpon the grave which swallos fast\nIt's peace at last, peace at last!\n\nEmpty they say,\nDeath, won't you let me stay?\nEmpty they say,\nDeath, hear me call your name\nCall your name... Suicide\n\nI've already died.\nYou're just the funeral I've been\nwaiting for... Cyanide\nliving dead inside\nBreak this empty shell forever more.\n\nForever more\nForever more\nIt's just the funeral I've been waiting for."}
