Yeah\nI want to be in love\n\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all I been thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, wil love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nTo find what it is everybody keeps on talking 'bout\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all a nigga thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, will love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nSomebody show me, what's it like to be in love?\n\nMy life has changed somehow, but still so much the same\nGot a bank account, I'm still broken down\nI need to know, where does this road go(hopefully someone for me)\nFamily, is that so much to ask Thee?\nBegging please\nFeel like I'm going mad\nI'd trade all I have\nJust to know...\n\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all I been thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, wil love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nTo find what it is everybody keeps on talking 'bout\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all a nigga thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, will love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nSomebody show me, what's it like to be in love?\n\nI know love is something that you can't go out and buy\nWhen you looking, always seems like it's the wrong time\nBut I hope one day I'll give away this heart of mine\nGirl I think I'm ready\nI wanna know love\n\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all I been thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, wil love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nTo find what it is everybody keeps on talking 'bout\nWhat's it like to be in love? That's all a nigga thinking of\nAnd I was just wondering, will love ever know me?\nAnd my heart is open, and I've been hoping\nSomebody show me, what's it like to be in love?\n\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love\nWhat's it like to be in love"}
