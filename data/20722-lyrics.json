Myers, Gary Baker)\n\nTimes are tough on an honest heart. \nPeople don't follow through with what they start.\nLyin' eyes looking at me up and down. \n\nMakin' talk that's only cheap. \nMakin' promises they never keep. \nBut I keep lookin' for what I still haven't found.\n\nOne honest heart. \nThat I can believe in. \nTwo lovin' arms that will never let me go.\nOne good man that I can count on. \nIt shouldn't be so hard. \nFindin' one honest heart. \n\nNow I've been close a time or two. \nI thought I saw my dream comin' true.\nBut I was just livin' in a fairy tale. \n\nI won't play the fool again. \nI won't play a game that I can't win. \nBut I still have faith and keep tellin' myself. There's...\n\nOne honest heart. \nThat I can believe in. \nTwo lovin' arms that will never let me go.\nOne good man that I can count on. \nIt shouldn't be so hard. \nFindin' one honest heart.\n\nWell, I dont think I'm asking to much\nJust once in my life\nI want to be touched by\nOne honest heart. That I Can Believe in\nTwo lovin' arms that will never let me go.\nOne good man that I can count on. \nIt shouldn't be so hard. \nIt shouldn't be so hard\nFindin' one honest heart.\n\nOne good man, One honest heart\n"}
