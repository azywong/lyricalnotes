Ratatat, yeah!\nNa-na-na-nah\nNa-na-na-nah\n\n[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]\nCrush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit\nFeeling lit, feeling right, 2 AM, summer night\nI don't care, hand on the wheel\nDriving drunk, I'm doing my thing\nRolling in the Midwest side and out\nLiving my life, getting out dreams\nPeople told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out \"Fuck that\"\nI'mma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back\nIf I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest\nIf I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets\n\n[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]\nTell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming?\nYou don't really know about nothing, nothing\nTell me what you know about them night terrors every night\n5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?\nTell me what you know about dreams, dreams?\nTell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing\nYou don't really care about the trials of tomorrow\nRather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow\n\n[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n[Bridge: Kid Cudi]\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness\nI know everything that shine ain't always gold\nI'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n[Guitar Solo: Ratatat]\n\n[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n[Outro: Kid Cudi]\nPursuit of happiness, yeah\nI gon' get it, I'll be good\nOh... oh man, oh, ugh\nRoom's spinning, room's spinning\nPat, Zuli...\nOh fuck, oh my God\nWhy'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh\nOh, fuck"}
