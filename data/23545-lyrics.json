(Flashing lights)\nWhat do I know? (Flashing lights)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI know it's been a while, sweetheart\nWe hardly talk, I was doin' my thang\nI know it was foul, baby\nAye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain\nAnd if somebody woulda told me a month ago\nFrontin' though: yo, I wouldn't wanna know\nIf somebody woulda told me a year ago\nIt'll go get this difficult\nFeelin' like Katrina with no FEMA\nLike Martin with no Gina\nLike a flight with no visa\nFirst class with the seat back, I still see ya\nIn my past, you on the other side of the glass\nOf my memory's museum\nI'm just sayin', hey Mona Lisa\nCome home, you know you can't roam without Caesar\n\n[Hook: Dwele]\nAs I recall I know you love to show off\nBut I never thought that you would take it this far\nWhat do I know? (Flashing lights)\nWhat do I know? (Flashing lights)\n\n[Outro: Dwele]\nAs you recall you know I love to show off\nBut you never thought that I would take it this far\nWhat do you know? (Flashing lights)\nWhat do you know? (Flashing lights)\n(Flashing lights, flashing lights)\n(Lights, lights, lights, lights, lightsâ€¦)"}
