I just keep holding you down\nI feel so stupid,\nfoolish\nLoving you this way\nBut what can i say?\nBut I wanna go\n(I wanna go but I keep coming back)\n\nWhy I’m so confused?\nFor you I have no answer boy\nWhy I fail to use boy just like a toy?\nIt’s a shame that you don’t care enough to even give me half the love\nI give to you\nI live for you, baby\nI'm ashamed to say that I’m the blame for how you act\n'Cause I keep coming\n(I keep coming back)\n\n(Keep goin' in circles, circles)\nRound and round\nAnd why I’m doing me so wrong? I just keep holding you down\nI feel so stupid,\nfoolish\nLoving you this way\nBut what can i say?\nBut I wanna go\n(I wanna go but I keep coming back)\n\nI can’t stop, I\nI can’t, I can’t stop missing you baby\nAnd I, I, I can't stop\nI, I, I can't stop\n\nI’ll stay 'cause I love you but I hate that I stay\nYou know I won't go\nThat’s why you treat me this way\nI wanna be happy,\nthough it hurts me so bad\nDon’t know what it is that keeps me coming back.\n\nHold up wait up a minute\n\n(Keep goin' in circles, circles)\nRound and round\nAnd why I’m doing me so wrong? I just keep holding you down\nI feel so stupid,\nfoolish\nLoving you this way\nBut what can i say?\nBut I wanna go\n(I wanna go but I keep coming back)\n[2x]"}
