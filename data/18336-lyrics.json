I missed the bus..\nI missed the bus.. I missed the bus..\n\n[Verse 1]\nI went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME\nEarly came around then late wouldn't LET ME\nWake up - WAKE UP -so I can get dressed\nI guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest\nAnd when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00\nJumped in the shower and I know I was late\nStepped out put on my jeans and my uni'\nAnd said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined\nBut I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED\nI ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS\nNow I'm hopin to myself everything is cool\nStandin on my block like a fool\nBut I'm all alone and the bus is gone\nif I miss school this weekend I'll be at home\nCan somebody come real fast to my rescue \nI'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do \n\n[Chorus: repeat 2x] \n\nI missed the bus [ohh]\nI missed the bus\nI missed the bus [ohh]\nAnd that is somethin I will never ever ever do again\n\n[verse 2]\nI was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down \nThinkin I could chill 'til the time came around\nAnd I did - HE DID - but a little too long \nCause when I woke up yo the bus was gone\nI almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door\nAnd I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore\nOn the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up\nI guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck\nCause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted\nScuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted\nAnd when I got to school it was the same old thing\nStepped in the class and the school bell rang\nIt was nothin I could do, I tried to explain\nBut the teacher treated me like I was playin a game\nYOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win\nI learned to never miss my bus again\n\n[Chorus]"}
