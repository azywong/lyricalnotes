Why do the grey skies still keep coming on Any way the wind blows it feels a little colder now Was it in this life we had the perfect day Lately all the laughter seems so far away, so far away When did you stop loving me When did I stop loving you Blue skies are hiding now Leaving my life lost in doubt There are seasons, high and low Does it matter - there you go When did you stop loving me When did I stop loving you Blue skies are hiding now Leaving my life lost in doubt Yea, I loved you but now you're gone Does it matter, baby, I've got to know When did you stop loving me When did I stop loving you"}
