I'm searching for a real love\r\nSomeone to set my heart free\r\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\r\n\r\n(Vs.2)\r\nOooh, when I met you I just knew that\r\nyou would take my heart and run\r\nUntil you told me how you felt for me\r\nyou said I'm not the one\r\nSo I slowly came to see\r\nall of the things that you were made of\r\nand now I hope my dreams and inspirations\r\nlead me toward some real love\r\n\r\n(Chorus) 1x\r\n\r\n(Bridge)\r\nI got to have a real love\r\n\r\nLoves so true and oh baby\r\nI thought that love was you\r\nI thought you were the answer to\r\nthe question in my mind\r\nbut it seems that I was wrong\r\nif I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love\r\n\r\n(Vs.3)\r\nSo I try my best and pray to God\r\nhe'll send me someone real\r\nto caress me and to guide me towards\r\nthe love my heart can feel\r\nNow I know I can be faithful\r\nI can be your all in all\r\nI'll give you good luvin' through the summer time,\r\nwinter, spring, and fall\r\n\r\n(Chorus) 2x's\r\n\r\n(During 3rd chorus)\r\nYou see I'm searching for a real love\r\nand I don't know where to go\r\nBeen around the world and high and low\r\nand still I'll never know\r\nhow it feels to have a real love\r\n'cause it seems it's not around\r\ngotta end it in this way because it\r\nseems he can't be found\r\n\r\n(Chorus) 2x's"}
