(oooo yeah)\n\nWhen I lose the will to win,\nI just reach for you and \nI can reach the sky again.\nI can do anything,\n'Cause your love is so amazing;\n'Cause your love inspires me.\n\nAnd when I need a friend, \nyou're always on my side;\nGiving me faith, taking me through the night.\n\nFor a shield (For a shield) \nfrom the storm; (from the storm)\nFor a friend; for a love \n(for a love to keep me safe and warm)\nTo keep me safe and warm,\nI turn to you. (I turn to you)\nFor the strength (for the strength) to be strong;\nFor the will to carry on;\nFor everything you do;\nI turn to you. (ooo yeah oohhh)\n\nFor the arms to be my shelter through all the rain;\nFor truth that will never change;\nFor someone to lean on;\nFor a heart I can rely on through anything;\nFor the one who I can run to;\n(I turn to you)\n\nFor a shield from the storm;\nFor a friend; for a love \n(to keep me safe a warm yeah yeah,\nI turn to you)\nTo keep me safe and warm,\nI turn to you. (I turn to you)\nFor the strength (for the strength) to be strong;\nFor the will to carry on;\nFor everything you do; (everything you do)\nFor everything that's true;\n\nFor everything you do;\nFor everything that's true,\nI turn to you."}
