Oh, oh Lord.\nThis is just for me. (Hello, hello)\nMmm. My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my. (Laughs)\n\nKick off my shoes and relax my feet\nHit the kitchen grab my bite to eat\nNow it's been one of those crazy weeks\nAnd I gotta do something special for me\n\nSee, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi\nHave a massage, have a sip and then I'm ready\nGotta take time out (time out)\nAnd my real ladies know what I'm talking about... sing\n\nOooooooh, baby baby\nYou dont know what I've been going through\nSing it again now. Oooooooh, baby baby\nIt's obvious to see exactly what I need\n\nOne of those days\nWhen the sun is shining bright\nAnd my life is going right\nAnd the simple things are not wasted\n\nOne of those days\nWhen you're cruising in your car\nAnd you like to see the stars\nAnd it's warm outside and beautiful, yeah\n\nTonight, it's all about me\nJust wanna set my body free (body free)\nNevermind the TV\nTonight I'll just let a little TV watch me\nLight the candles, aroma therapy\nHot tub bubbles surrounding me\nMr. Big is in the background\nThe Isley Brothers gonna hold it down... sing\n\nChorus\n\nHello (7x)\nI need one of those days\nYou don't know\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nChorus"}
