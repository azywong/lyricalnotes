I'm on my knees\r\npraying for the day that you'll be mine!!\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nBridge:\r\nTo you...Hey Girl,I don't want you to cry no more - inside\r\nAll the money in the world could never add up to all the love\r\nthat I have inside ... I Love You baby\r\n\r\nBass break:\r\nAnd I will give it to you\r\nAll I can give,all I can give\r\nEverything I have is for you\r\nBut love is all I have to give\r\n\r\nDrum break & Chorus 3x and out:\r\nBut my love is all I have to give\r\nWithout you I don't think I can live\r\nI wish I could give the world to you ... but\r\nLove is all I have to give...to you."}
