Kick it!\n\nWe go way out where there ain't nobody!\nWe turn this cornfield into a party!\nPeddle to the floorboard eight up in a four door, \nburning up a backroad song\nPark it and we pile out baby watch your\nstep now. Better have your boots on\nKick the dust up (Kick The Dust Up)\nBack it on up!\nFill your cup up!\nThat's what's up, up!\nLet's kick the dust up!"}
