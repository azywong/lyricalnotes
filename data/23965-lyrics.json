Well I don't feel a thing\nI'd wake her up and say good bye but I can't recall her name\nAnything goes, when everything's gone\nYou ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong\nSo bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone\nIf you'd a left a single thread for me to hold on to\nI'd have one good reason not to do the things I do\n\n[Chorus]\""}
