D'you miss me?\nJessica Simpson, sing the chorus!\n\n[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]\nWhen you walked through the door\nIt was clear to me (Clear to me)\nYou’re the one they adore\nWho they came to see (Who they came to see)\n\nYou’re a rock star (Baby)\nEverybody wants you (Everybody wants you)\nPlayer, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)\nWe’re the ones who made you\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nAhem, back by popular demand\nNow pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can\nYou're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?\nHow does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?\n\nWell, look at all the massive masses in the stands\n\"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!\"\nDamn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man\nShe stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands\n\nOn her massive gluteus maximus again\nSqueeze it then squish it, then pass it to a friend\nCan he come back as nasty as he can?\nYes, he can-can; don't ask me this again\n\nHe does not mean to lesbian offend\nBut Lindsay, please come back to seeing men\nSamantha's a 2; you're practically a 10\nI know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin\nNow come in, girl!\n\n[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]\nWhen you walked through the door\nIt was clear to me (Clear to me)\nYou’re the one they adore\nWho they came to see (Who they came to see)\n\nYou’re a rock star (Baby)\nEverybody wants you (Everybody wants you)\nPlayer, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)\nWe’re the ones who made you\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nThe enforcer, looking for more women to torture\nWalk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her\nSorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres\nHave that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?\n\nWell, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman\nGive me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine\nAnd I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then\nNail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!\n\nBrit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman\nForget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again\nAnd this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge\nForget them other men, girl, pay them little attention\n\nAnd little did I mention that Jennifer's in\nLove with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench\nMan, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch\nThey take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim's\n\n[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]\nWhen you walked through the door\nIt was clear to me (Clear to me)\nYou’re the one they adore\nWho they came to see (Who they came to see)\n\nYou’re a rock star (Baby)\nEverybody wants you (Everybody wants you)\nPlayer, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)\nWe’re the ones who made you\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nAnd that's why, my love\nYou'll never live without\nI know you want me, girl\n'Cause I can see you're checking me out\n\nAnd baby, you know\nYou know you want me too\nDon't try to deny it, baby\nI'm the only one for you (*fart*)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nDamn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa\nWhy should I wash my filthy mouth out?\nYou think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album\nNever has there been such finesse and nostalgia\n\nMan, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but\nJessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (blup!)\nWowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers\nAnd they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis\n\n\"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt\nLooking like someone shrinked his outfit!\"\nI think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica\nRest assured Superman's here to rescue ya\n\nCan you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake\nMatter of fact, bake me a birthday cake\nWith a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak\nBaby, I think you just met your soulmate\nNow break it down, girl\n\n[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]\nWhen you walked through the door\nIt was clear to me (Clear to me)\nYou’re the one they adore\nWho they came to see (Who they came to see)\n\nYou’re a rock star (Baby)\nEverybody wants you (Everybody wants you)\nPlayer, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)\nWe’re the ones who made you\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nSo baby\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, get down\n\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, down, down\nBaby, get down, get down\n\nOh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!\nI can't wait, I'm going back\nHa ha, woo!\nDr. Dre! 2020!\nYeah!"}
