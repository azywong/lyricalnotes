Damn\nI used to be the kid that no one cared about\nThat's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out\n\n[Hook: Eric Turner]\nOh, written in the stars\nA million miles away, a message to the main, oh\nSeasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I’m on my way\n\n[Bridge: Eric Turner & Tinie Tempah]\nOh, oh, oh, oh (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\n\n[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]\nYeah, I needed a change\nWhen we ate we never tipped because we needed the change\nI needed a break\nFor a sec I even gave up believing and praying\nI even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray\nThey say that money is the root to the evilist ways\nBut have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake?\nMate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great\nIt feels like a long time coming, fam\nSince the day I thought of that cunning plan\nOne day I had a dream, I tried to chase it\nBut I wasn’t going nowhere, running man\nI knew that maybe someday I would understand\nTryna change a tenner to a hundred grand\nEveryone's a kid that no one cares about\nYou just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out\n\n[Hook: Eric Turner]\nOh, written in the stars\nA million miles away, a message to the main, oh\nSeasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I’m on my way\n\n[Bridge: Eric Turner & Tinie Tempah]\nOh, oh, oh, oh (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh (iSHI)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (Eric Turner)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  (Let's go)\n\n[Hook: Eric Turner]\nOh, seasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I’m on my way"}
