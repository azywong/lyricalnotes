That's right Hee Hee\n[Eagle-Eye Cherry:]\nLadies and gentlemen- Neneh Cherry\n\n[Verse 1:]\nWell you laughed at me right in my face\nAt the wrong time and in the wrong place\nYou turned around and said \"I'm all shook up\"\nSaid to me \"I'm your sweet buttercup\nYou're lying, you're lying, begging him to stay and crying\nYou're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied\n\n[Chorus:]\nHeart, heart you can't break my heart\nHard, hard you think you're so hard\nIf you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad\nBut you did it in spite and that just isn't right\n\n[Verse 2:]\nYou took my man, the only one I ever had\nYou took my man, I didn't treat you bad\n\n*Anyway, it's gonna get you anyway\nAny day, it's gonna get you*\n\nYou took my man and didn't mean it\nBut you did it to hurt my feelings\nWhat I should do is slap you in your face\nYou left me here with a pain below my waste\nYou lose a guy you move into the larder\nYou got no style, why don't you try a little harder\nChocolates, bananas, doughnuts and salami\nAin't gonna fit coz you're full of boloni\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nOnly back alley rats take other peoples cats\nAnd then strike back, that isn't where I'm at\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI thought you were my friend... God, you're just so digital girl\nYou're like one of those cabbage patch creatures - DJ!\n\nYou're burning the candle at both ends, you're gonna feel the heat\nIf everything you do comes back to you, by now you'd be dead meat\nYou took my man and took his body\nStrapped him to your bed just to have his baby\nEverybody knows you're a phoney\nYou just want his alimony\n\n[Chorus]"}
