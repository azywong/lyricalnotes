There's concrete all\nAround him, but Daddy won't sell the farm\n\nYou can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep\nYou can't pull roots when they run that deep\nHe's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm\nDaddy won't sell the farm\n\nOne day he's gonna leave it all to me and I'll start my own branch of the family tree\nThey'll get the message written on the roof of the barn, Daddy won't sell the farm\n\nYou can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep\nYou can't pull roots when they run that deep\nHe's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm\nDaddy won't sell the farm\n\nWe're gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm\nDaddy won't sell the farm. Oh you know a country boy can survive"}
