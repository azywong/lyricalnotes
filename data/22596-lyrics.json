I don't need to hear you say \nThat if we weren't so alike \nYou'd like me a whole lot more \n\nListen to me now \nI need to let you know \nYou don't have to go it alone \n\nAnd it's you when I look in the mirror \nAnd it's you when I pick up the phone \nSometimes you can't make it on your own \n\nI know that we don't talk \nI'm sick of it all \nCan you hear me when I sing \nYou're the reason I sing \nYou're the reason why the opera is in me... \n\nWhere are we now? \nStill got to let you know \nA house still doesn't make a home \nDon't leave me here alone... \n\nAnd it's you when I look in the mirror \nAnd it's you that makes it hard to let go \nSometimes you can't make it on your own \nSometimes you can't make it \nThe best you can do is to fake it \nSometimes you can't make it on your own"}
