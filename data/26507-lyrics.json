If you fool me we can't get fooled again\n\nFool me one time shame on you\nFool me twice, can't put the blame on you\nFool me three times, fuck the peace signs\nLoad the chopper, let it rain on you\n\nFool me one time shame on you\nFool me twice, can't put the blame on you\nFool me three times, fuck the peace signs\nLoad the chopper, let it rain on you\n\nMy only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet\nMy only regret was too young for Nia Long\nNow all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows\nHand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along\nMy only regret was too young for Sade Adu\nMy only regret could never take Aaliyah home\nNow all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone\nWith the stale face cause they know it's they song\nShe shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)\nShe shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)\nShe shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)\nShe shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)\n\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\n\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved\nDon't save her\nShe don't wanna be saved"}
