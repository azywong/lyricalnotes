See,\n\n[Chorus:]\nI don't wanna be loved\nI don't wanna be loved\nI just wanna quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickeys\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved\nI don't wanna be loved\nI just wanna quick fix\nUp in your mix miss\nSend me your wishlist\nI have you addicted\nSo mami come hit this\n\nMami I realize that I'm manish\nSpeak a language of love like Spanish\n\"Quero Fugir\"\nI'm so obscene and know what I mean?\nYeah sorry that was Portuguese\nAnd I speak with ease\nPlease (aha) get on them knees\nI gotta penny for your thoughts\nIf you know what I mean\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDon't be offended babe\nBy what I say\nIt's just a game\nAnd how I play\nPillage and plunder\nCall me your plumber\nKnock on this wood\nGet rocked by this thunder [x2]\n\n[Chorus]"}
