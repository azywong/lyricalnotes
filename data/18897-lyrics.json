Fret it or forget it\nI'm like the short and fly so I'mma still get paid, I don't sweat it\nI'm every MC's nightmare manifesting\nA little shorty pushing the fact that I'm best in\nThis shit called hip-hop, raise the throne\nKid, don't front, I got you open in your dome\n\n[Hook]\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid (Repeat x8)\n\n[Verse 2]\nRest in peace to my niggas in the East\nAnd all the real niggas that was shot by beast\nAround the way all we do is spark mad ism\nLadies be like, \"Yo, he's Buckshot right there, that is him\"\nBut let's get with the cipher, kid, pass the eight\nSo I can wet my lungs and blow smoke in your face\nWord to Jah, niggas can't touch me, kid\nCause I'm too nice to do bids or ever hit skid\nFronts in the bottom of my teeth like whatever shit\nOn the real, gettin played, what, I never did\nCause on the mic I gotta represent the real niggas\nThe field niggas get the muthafuckin ill triggers\nWord to Herb, lick shot with my verb\nAnd keep my hand on my grip when I play the curb\nI never got caught by a undercover DT\nNah chill E T&T can't see me\nYou grab mics from the ones I left broken\nKid, don't front, you know I got you open\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLate at night, I catch a buzz, then I write\nThe type of ill shit to make the mind feel tight\nAnd be wanting to battle like every five minutes\nBut I'm in this like Guinness so that ass get finished\nStraight from the floors of hell, feel the flame\nYou faggot ass, I heard your nickname's Blaine\nI hit your brain and you felt the pain, maintain\nWhen it comes to a battle you know the Buck reigns\nI overthrow the flow, niggas be like, \"Yo, how'd you do that?\"\nBitches be like \"Yo who that, you're all that, yo, true that\"\nNever forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it\nI used to make money, now I just take it\nI do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete\nBucking niggas down cause they think shit is sweet\nI keep a Tec whenever I'm in the projects\nEase out, then flex, in effect like Wreckx\nBuck to your head, now die is my slogan\nDon't front, you know I got you open\n\n[Hook]"}
