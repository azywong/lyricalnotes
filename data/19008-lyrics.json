Who cared? Foolish pride\nNever was a good seat at any of this man's shows\n\nUntil now all I wanted 2 do is\nDo do do what I do, and\nBang bang bang on the drummer\nAnd love so-and-so\n\nBut now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let the vibe just flow\nI wanna just letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let my feelings show\n(letitgo)\nI'm ready 4 the real\nGive me something I can feel\n\nAll my life this heart's been under lock and key\nMy curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home\nTrigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except 4 me\nBetter off dead if I couldn't be alone\n\nUntil now all I wanted 2 do is\nDo do do what I do, and\nBang bang bang on the drummer\nAnd love so-and-so\n\nBut now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let the vibe just flow\nI wanna just letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let my feelings show\nI, I'm ready 4 the real\nGive me something I can feel\n\n4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song\nBut a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on\nBut now I've got an army and we're three million strong\nThis song will ring in your ears when we are gone\n\nUntil now all I wanted 2 do is\nDo do do what I do, and\nBang bang bang on the drummer\nAnd love so-and-so\n\nBut now I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let the vibe just flow\nSaid I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)\nLay back and let the feelings show\n\nI am ready 4 the real (Come a little closer)\n\n(letitgo)\n(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)\n"}
