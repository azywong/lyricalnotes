Aw, not again\nSo you're packin' your bags\nAnd you're leaving? But that ain't right\nYou need to stay awhile, think about it\nBut wait a minute, before you go\nThere's just one thing I want you to know\nWe both agree that this love\nAin't what it used to be, we just grew apart\nI got nothin' but love for you, baby\nGirl, you'll always be my heart\nIt's gonna to be strange living without you\nAin't felt so empty before, no\nSee, I miss your smile\nAnd even your fussin'\nWhen I left my clothes on the floor\nOh, baby, say now\nI'm gonna miss your face\nI'm gonna miss your moods\nI'm gonna miss makin' love to you\nAnd even though you haven't gone yet\nI'm already missing you\nI'm already missing you\nIt's hard to say goodbye\nBut things will be better\nYou go your way and I will go mine\nLet's keep in touch\nLet me know how you're doing\nGirl, things will change in time\nDon't want you to leave\nKeep sayin' I'm sorry\nBut I guess I'm repeating myself\nGirl, you know I'm here\nWhen you need a shoulder\nI can't see you in the arms\nOf someone else, oh baby\nI'm gonna miss your face\nI'm gonna miss your moods\nI'm gonna miss makin' love to you\nI'm gonna miss your face\nI'm gonna miss your moods\nI'm gonna miss makin' love to you\nI'm gonna miss your face\nI'm gonna miss your moods\nI'm gonna miss makin' love to you\nI'm gonna miss your face\nI'm gonna miss your moods\nI'm gonna miss makin' love to you\n..."}
