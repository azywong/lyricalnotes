Succeed?\nLive or die?\nI just got to believe\n\n[Verse 1]\nBelieve, it's worth saving\nAnd to get lost, lost in a day dream\nSo why hesitate? Take me to another place\nSo far, far away, so I can get out of the dark\nHigh speed, like I'm racing\nJust like lighting, the sky is blazing\nBut you've lost your way, you've been lead astray\nAre there better days for my fallen dreamer?\n\n[Chorus]\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nYou don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more\nDream no more, you don't even dream no more\nDreamer, dreamer\nWhy don't you just dream again?\n\n[Verse 2]\nBelieve in you\nYou've got something to prove\nYou're a star, watch you shine bright\nOn your way to the limelight, finish line\nThe sweat and tears\nYou can channel all of your fears\nOpen your eyes, your eyes\nAnd it will be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nYou don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more\nDream no more, you don't even dream no more\nDreamer, dreamer\nWhy don't you just dream again?\n\n[Bridge]\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\n\n[Chorus]\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nCalling a dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nA dreamer, a a a a dreamer\nYou don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more\nDream no more, you don't even dream no more\nDreamer, dreamer\nWhy don't you just dream again?"}
