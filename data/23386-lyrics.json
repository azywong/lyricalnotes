Sean Kingston!\n\nChorus:\nYou're way too beautiful girl\nThat's why it'll never work\nYou'll have me suicidal, suicidal\nWhen you say it's over\nDamn all these beautiful girls\nThey only wanna do your dirt\nThey'll have you suicidal, suicidal\nWhen they say it's over\n\nVerse 1:\nSee it started at the park\nUsed to chill at the dark\nOh when you took my heart\nThat's when we fell apart\nCoz we both thought\nThat love lasts forever (lasts forever)\nThey say we're too young\nTo get ourselves sprung\nOh we didn't care\nWe made it very clear\nAnd they also said\nThat we couldn't last together (last together)\n\nSee it's very define, girl\nOne of a kind\nBut you mush up my mind\nYou walk to get declined\nOh Lord...\nMy baby is driving me crazy\n\n(Chorus)\nYou're way too beautiful girl\nThat's why it'll never work\nYou'll have me suicidal, suicidal\nWhen you say it's over\nDamn all these beautiful girls\nThey only wanna do your dirt\nThey'll have you suicidal, suicidal\nWhen they say it's over\n\nVerse 2:\nIt was back in '99\nWatchin' movies all the time\nOh when I went away \nFor doin' my first crime\nAnd I never thought \nThat we was gonna see each other (see each other)\nAnd then I came out\nMami moved me down South\nOh I'm with my girl\nWho I thought was my world\nIt came out to be\nThat she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)\n\nSee it's very define, girl\nOne of a kind\nBut you mush up my mind\nYou walk to get declined\nOh Lord...\nMy baby is driving me crazy\n\n(Chorus)\nYou're way too beautiful girl\nThat's why it'll never work\nYou'll have me suicidal, suicidal\nWhen you say it's over\nDamn all these beautiful girls\nThey only wanna do your dirt\nThey'll have you suicidal, suicidal\nWhen they say it's over\n\nVerse 3:\nNow we're fussin'\nAnd now we're fightin'\nPlease tell me why\nI'm feelin' slightin'\nAnd I don't know\nHow to make it better (make it better)\nYou're datin' other guys\nYou're tellin' me lies\nOh I can't believe\nWhat I'm seein' with my eyes\nI'm losin' my mind\nAnd I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)\n\nYou're way too beautiful girl\nThat's why it'll never work\nYou'll have me suicidal, suicidal\nWhen you say it's over"}
