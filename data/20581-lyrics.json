No sir. No way.\nI wouldn't give my heart up. \nGonna keep my guard up. \nAnd save it for another day.\nThen you walked in with that crazy grin. \nAnd everything I swore before got lost in your eyes.\nAnd flew right out the door.\n\nCHORUS\nSuddenly I heard love songs. \nPlaying real soft on the jukebox. \nSomebody ordered up moonlight.\nAnd painted stars all across the sky. \nIs it gravity or destiny. \nEither way there's nothing I can do. \nLooks like I picked the wrong night. \nNot to fall in love with you. \n\nI briefly resisted but my heart insisted. \nIt was gonna be giving in. \nHard as I was trying there was no denying.\nWhich one of us would win.  \nYou came up beside me and asked if I'd be wantin' to have dance. \nAnd right then I knew.This\nthing was out of my hands.\n\n"}
