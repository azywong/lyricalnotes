Instrumental Break .:\n       (Yeah!)\n\n      Now there's a lotta guys like me out there,\n      In a lotta little towns.\n      Now, tellin' all our buddies,\n      We won't ever settle down.\n      We say that's just the way we are,\n      An' the way we'll always be.\n      So God sends girls like you for guys like me.\n      Thank God there's girls like you for guys like me.\n\n:.
