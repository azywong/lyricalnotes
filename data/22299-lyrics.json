Why do you wanna throw it away like this\nSuch a mess. I don't want to watch you.\n\nDisconnect and self destruct one bullet at a time\nWhat's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die\n\nMedicated, drama queen, picture perfect, numb belligerence\nNarcissistic, drama queen, craving fame and all its decadence\n\nLying through your teeth again\nSuicidal imbecile\nThink about it, put it on the fautline\nWhat'll it take to get it through to you precious\nGo with this, why do you wanna throw it away like this\nSuch a mess, I don't wanna watch you...\n\nDisconnect and self destruct one bullet at a time\nWhat's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die\n\nThey were right about you\nThey were right about you\n\nLying to my face again\nSuicidal imbecile\nThink about it put it on the fautline\nWhat'll it take to get it through to you precious\nOver this, why do you wanna throw it away like this\nSuch a mess, Coalesce, Coalesce\n\nDisconnect and self destruct, one bullet at a time\nWhat's your hurry, everyone will have his day to die\nIf you choose to pull the trigger, should your drama prove sincere,\nDo it somewhere far away from here"}
