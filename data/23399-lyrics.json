Can you run all the lights?\nIf you can baby boy then we can go all night\n\nGoes from 0 to 60 in three point five\nBaby you got the keys\n\nNow shut up and drive\n(drive, drive, drive)\n\nShut up and drive\n(drive, drive, drive)\n\nI got class like a fifty-seven Cadillac.\nStart over drive with a whole lot of boom in the back.\nYou look like you can handle whats under my hood\nYou keep saying that you will boy \nI wish you would\n\nSo if you feel me let me know, know, know\nCome on now what you waiting for, for, for\nMy engine's ready to explode, plode, plode\nSo start me up and watch me go, go, go, go\n\nGet you where you wanna go if you know what I mean\nGot a ride that's smoother than a limousine\nCan you handle the curves?
