Well I want you to show me\nMy mama gone for the weekend\nSo Saturday baby we can get to freakin'\nThat's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'\nBaby, you done woke my lil' man up\nI'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed\nTeacher, please don't make me stand up\nI wrote back like \"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan\"\nStill trying to play it cool, sound like the man\nBut I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned\nTalking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin\nFuck\n\n[Refrão:]\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, nooo\nI ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\n\nYou know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time\nI'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time\nI'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with\nAnd most of all I'm praying, \"God don't let me bust quick\"\nI'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right\nPractice putting condoms on, how it go right\nI'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'\nWith a pocket full of rubbers and an erection\nThat's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing\nAnd a nigga roll over on top\nAnd then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing\nOn me, ooh girl don't stop\nIt's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced\nBut right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said\n\"I wanna get something off my mental\nI can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause\"\n\n[Refrão:]\nCause I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, nooo\nI ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no"}
