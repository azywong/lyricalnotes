Will you help me down?\nWill you get me right out of this god forsaken town?\nWill you make it all a little less cold?\n\nI can do that\nOh, I can do that\n\nWill you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?\nCan you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white\nCan you make it all a little less old?\n\nI can do that\nOh woah now, I can do that\n\nWill you make me some magic with your own two hands?\nCan you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?\nCan you give me something I can take home?\n\nNow, I can do that\nOh woah now, I can do that\n\nWill you cater to every fantasy I've got?\nWill you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha?\nWill you take me places I've never known?\n\nNow, I can do that\nOh woah now, I can do that\n\nAfter awhile you'll forget everything\nIt was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling\nAnd you'll see that it's time to move on\n\nI won't do that\nI won't do that\n\nI know the territory, I've been around\nIt'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down\nSooner or later, you'll be screwing around\n\nI won't do that\nNo, I won't do that\n\nAnything for love\nOh, I would do anything for love\nI would do anything for love\nBut I won't do that\nNo, I won't do that"}
