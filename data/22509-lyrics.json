Mash him and let him have it!\nMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up\n‘Cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication, the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?\nWell, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!\nBut I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think\nThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nWho's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus\nTo show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important\nIt is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'\nOff at your jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not goin' to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience\n‘Cause—\n\n[Hook]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left\nWe all fall down like toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win\nBut the battle wages on for toy soldiers"}
