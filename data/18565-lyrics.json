I don't know about that\n...As many times as we've loved\nShared love and made love\nIt doesn't seem to me\nLike it's ever, ever enough\nIt's just ... not enough, no, no\n\nCHORUS:\nMy darling, I, can't get enough of your love baby\nBoy I don't know I don't know why\nI can't get enough of your love baby\n\nOh some things I can't get used to\nNo matter how I try, oh\nIt seems the more you give the more I want\nAnd baby that's no lie, oh no\n\nTell me .. what can I say\nWhat am I gonna do\nHow should I feel, when everything is you you you\nWhat kind of a love is this\nThat you've given me\nIs it in your kiss or just because you're sweet, sweet\nYou're all I know and every time you're near\nI feel a change\nSomething's moving\nI scream your name\nWhat you got me doing\n\n(repeat chorus)\n\nIf I could only make you see\nAnd make you understand\nBoy your love for me is all I need now\nand more than I can stand\nOh well\n\nHow can I explain\nAll the things I feel\nYou've given me so much\nBoy you're so unreal, unreal, unreal\nWell I keep loving you\nMore and more each time\nBoy what am I gonna do\nCause you blown my mind, mind\nI got the same old feeling\nEvery time you're near\nI feel a change\nSomething's moving\nI scream your name\nWhat you got me doing\n\nBaby, it didn't take all of my life to find you\nAnd it sure ain't gonna take the rest of my life\nTo keep ya, yeah, keep ya, happy\nNo darling darling darling darling  happy   oooh\n\n"}
