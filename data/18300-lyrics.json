Yeah\nHave you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have?\nDid you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart?\nHave you ever needed someone so bad?\nAnd you're the girl I gotta have, I gotta have you baby, yeah\nThere you go, midnight promises again, yeah\nBut they're broken by the dawn\nYou wanna go further, faster everyday, baby\nBut in the morning you'll be gone and I'm alone\nWhy save your kisses for a rainy day\nBaby, let the moment take your heart away\nHave you ever needed someone so bad? Yeah\nHave you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have?\nDid you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart?\nHave you ever needed someone so bad?\nEvery dream I dream is like some kinda rash 'n' reckless scene\nTo give out such crazy love you must be some kinda drug\nAnd if my time don't ever come for me you're still the one\nDamned if I don't, damned if I do, I gotta get a fix on you\nHave you ever needed someone so bad? Yeah\nHave you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have?\nDid you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart?\nHave you ever needed someone so bad, so bad?\nHave you ever wanted someone\nHave you ever wanted someone? Yeah\nDid you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart?\nHave you ever needed someone so bad?\nAnd you're the girl I gotta have, I gotta have you baby? Yeah\nIt's a game I just can't win, oh\nHave you ever needed someone so bad? Yeah\nHave you ever wanted someone?\nHave you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have?\nDid you ever tried so hard? Yeah"}
