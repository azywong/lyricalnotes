(yeah yeah)\nCuz I'mma make you dance (uh huh)\nAll I want is for you to use your imagination (come on)\n\nThat's all\nCome on\nCome on\n\n1 - What makes us do\nThe things we do\nThat keeps me lovin' you (imagination)\nAnd when you're in need\nAin't got nobody\nImagination sets you free, free\n\nEverything you want is real close\nWhen you close your eyes\nAnd the things you think about the most\nThey come to life (come to life)\nWhen your relationship is headed for the rocks\nGotta use your imagination to get you back on top\n\nRepeat 1\n\nIt's the place you look\nWhen you want to have some fun\nWhen you see it, say it, before it's done (uh huh)\nImagine you and me, and how it would feel\nExploring new ideas and what's gon' keep this lovin' real\n\nWhen you get lonely (lonely)\nIt'll make you get to a phone and\nTell me how much you want me\nAnd when you have a bad day\nA little bit of imagination goes a long way\n\n[JD]\nOh, true buff playa, that's the Chichi\nWanna get up out the store, you need to see me\nNow I got you wondering what's behind the slouch\nIf you get too close will you get turned out\nNo doubt, it won't be the same if I hit it\nCuz you always gon' want it the way I did it\nI'mma keep you fresh, make sure you stay kitted\nSee once I got it, can't nobody else get it \nFrom the bottom to the top\n'Till you say stop\nYou and me, wit the freaky South, I'mma gray drop\nI'll kiss everything, I don't miss a spot\nStuff you ain't never seen from the man you got\nI ain't hatin', my imagination's just more advanced\nSo when you wanna dance, I'mma make you dance\nTamia I see ya, I'm still waiting\nYou make me wanna, leave that to your imagination\nYeah, yeah\n\nRepeat 1 \n\nRepeat 1 while:\nGo 'head, baby, go 'head, baby\n\nRepeat 1\n"}
