Come get some\nNigga it's murder one when I toss my gun\nYou might see me let it off, you might see me run\nBut you won't see shit time the police come\nHuh? You want some? Come get some\nNigga it's murder one when you see my gun\nI just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done\nYou just bleed and bleed 'til the police come\nHuh? You want some?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple\nShooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you\nGot more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want, boy\nYou wanna be nice to me, you wanna shoot dice with me\nYou want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?\nNigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit\nYou got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch\nGetting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary\nAnd I'm saying that house should be a crack house\nNow see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out\nThe tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus\nThe Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'\nI let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign\nClick-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded\nToss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it\n'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nCome get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it\nCome get it - huh? You want some?\nCome get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it\nFuck that nigga - huh? You want some?"}
