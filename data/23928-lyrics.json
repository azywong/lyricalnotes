Maybe I can help you\nMy tank is full, Id be obliged to take you\n\nCause Im a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive\nClimb in my bed and Ill take you for a ride\nUp city streets, down country roads\nI can get you where you need to go\nCause Im a country boy\n\nYou sure look good sitting in my right seat\nBuckle up and Ill take you through the five speeds\nWind it up or I can slow it way down\nIn the woods or right up town\n\nIm a country boy, got a four-wheel drive\nClimb in my bed and Ill take you for a ride\nUp city streets, down country roads\nYeah, I can get you where you need to go\nCause Im a country boy\n\nBig thirty-fives, winding on the asphalt\nGrabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt\nCause Im a country boy\n\nMy mufflers loud, dual thrust tubes\nCrank the music and the tone gets real good\nLet me know when we're getting close\nYou can slide on out or we can head on down the road\n\nCause Im a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive\nClimb in my bed and Ill take you for a ride\nUp city streets, down country roads\nYeah, I can get you where you want to go\nCause Im a country boy\n\nBucket seats, soft as babys nude butt\nLocking [incomprehensible] to take you through a deep rut\n\nCause Im a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive\nClimb in my bed and Ill take you for a ride\nUp city streets, down winding roads\nYeah, I can get you where you need to go\nCause Im a country boy\n\nYeah, Im a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive\nClimb in my bed and Ill take you for a ride\nUp city streets, down country roads\nI can get you where you want to go\nCause Im a country boy, yeah, Im a country boy\nAh, Im just a country boy, a nice little country boy"}
