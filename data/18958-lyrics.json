Oh, oh...\n\nThe night is so pretty\nAnd so young\nThe night is so pretty\nAnd so young\nSo very young... Yeah!\n\nSleeping in my car\nI will undress you\nSleeping in my car\nI will caress you\nStaying in the back seat of my car\nMaking love, to you!\n\nSleeping in my car\nI will posess you\nSleeping in my car\nCertainly bless you\nLaying in the back seat of my car\nMaking up, making up..."}
