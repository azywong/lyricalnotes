Oh, no. No no no no\n\nIf you must know the truth boy, I'm nothing without you\nIt's funny how I know what people mean, boy\nWhen it's too good to be true\nBecause you give me joy, good love, good times\nSuch happiness, oh yeah\nAnd every day I thank the Lord for you\nI feel so blessed\n\nI need for you to love me, (love me)\nHold me, (hold me)\nTouch me\nDown deep in my soul, never let it go\nCause the love we share; no one compares to you\nI'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)\nCause I really love you so\nOh I, I'll never let you go. Oh, no. No no no no\n\nIf you only knew what you really do ain't never have no one\nThat does it quite\nLike you do\nYou could spend half a lifetime tryin to find one like you\nThat's why I am so glad I found you baby\nI wished upon a star and then it came true\n\nDARLIN!!\nI need for you to love me. (love me)\nHold me, (hold me)\nTouch me, (touch me)\nDown deep in my soul, I'll never let it go\nCause the love we share; no one compares to you\nI'll never let you go. Cause I really love you so\nNo I, I'll never let you go. No no. Oooohh"}
