Would you like that?\nAnd I don't mind if you say this love is the last time\nSo now I'll ask do you like that? Do you like that?\n\nNo!\n\nSomething's getting in the way, something's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nSo tell me how it should be\n\nTry to find out, what makes you tick as I lie down\nSore and sick, do you like that? Do you like that?\nThere's a fine line, between love and hate and I don't mind\nJust let me say that I like that, I like that!\n\nSomething's getting in the way, something's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nAs I burn another page, as I look the other way\nI still try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nSo tell me how it should be\n\nDesperate I will crawl, waiting for so long\nNo love, there is no love\nDie for anyone, what have I become?\n\nSomething's getting in the way, something's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nAs I burn another page, as I look the other way\nI still try to find my place in the diary of Jane"}
