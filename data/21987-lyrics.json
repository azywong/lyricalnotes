(RAHHHHHH!!!)\n\nI liked\nHaving hurt!\nSo send the pain below,\nSo send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (I liked...),\nSo send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (...Having hurt),\nSo send the pain below (Much like suffocating),\nSo send the pain below (Much like suffocating),\nSo send the pain below."}
