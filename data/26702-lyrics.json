Real from Cypress Hill\nHow I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt\nI rhyme like life is still an uphill climb\nReady to face it, each challenge waitin'\nTaste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation\nLook what I have built, reputation is delegation\nThe only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing\nOnly thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement\nAn accusation, I am legendary status, in fact\nThat is the only way you'll ever be able to say\nYour legend is makin' an allegation\nI write with the left\nSame hand I hold the mic with\nAs I fight to the death, 'til my last breath\nManaged to prove who the best man is\nSurveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing\nIn the end\nBut I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage\nOf knowing what it's like to be southpaw\nCause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed\nCause I am\n\nI am phenomenal\nWith every ounce of my blood\nWith every breath in my lungs\nWon't stop until I'm phe-no-menal\nI am phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I would never say, oh, it's impossible\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal\nPhenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal"}
