Am I the stranger in the rain?\nI am alone\n\nAnd if there glory there to behold\nMaybe it's my imagination\nAnother story there to be told\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I play, I'll wait\nAnd I pray it's not too late\nWe made it so far\nJust a beat of a lonely heart\nAnd it's mine\nAnd I don't want to be alone\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd all the wonders made for the earth\nAnd all the hearts in all creation\nAnother story there to be told\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I play, I'll wait\nAnd I pray it's not too late\nWe made it so far\nJust a beat of a lonely heart\nAnd it's mine\nAnd I don't want to be alone\n\n[Outro]\nGone but not out of sight\nI'm caught in the rain and there's no one home\nFace the heat of the night\nThe one that you love got a heart that's made of stone\n\nShine and search for the light\nAnd sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean\nAnd clean out of sight\nI'm caught in the rain and there's no one home\n\nFace the heat of the night\nThe one that you love got a heart that's made of stone\n\nShine and search for the light\nAnd sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean\n\nAnd clean out of sight\nI'm caught in the rain and there's no one home"}
