Yeah I know I'm wrong\nFor goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'\nHopin' ya \"Home Alone\" like Caulkin\nBut I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected\n\n[Chorus 1X]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm so sick of bein' lon-\nAHH, don't finish yo statement\nYou alone call me, I'll be yo replacement\nPut me in the game coach, you can let that lame go\nLet me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles\nCuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller\nFrom the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy\nHoney you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a plate of neck bones\nTenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me\nCuz I be goin' and goin', growin'\nPut mo' motion in ya ocean from night to mornin'\nHeavy huffin' and puffin'\nBreath stankin' and yawnin'\nSomething so pretty as you\nAt home alone, that's unbelieveable\nLike when the cow jumped over the moon, now\nI never put nuttin' before you\nThat's like eatin' cereal and pickin' a fork over a spoon \n\n[Chorus 2x]\n\nThis is a jazzifizle purductshisle my nizzle ha Jazzie Faith Field Mob Torika \nIt's a beautiful daddy OOOOOWWWEEEEE \"OH BOY\"\n\n[chorus]\nI'm so sick of being lon-\n"}
