Lordy\nSomething you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang\nThe heart beat of the heartland\nShe’s got a drawl yall, yeah\nShe’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world\nLet there be cowgirls, come on\n\nHe met me back in ’68\nThe first time I met her I was nearly eight\nAnd she was ten\nHer name was little Kay Lynn\nShe was born to a farmer who was friends with my father\nI was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter\nThought I was in, it made me think again\n\nBut when I turned 16\nI thought it couldn’t get worse\nI saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt\n\nLet there be cowgirls for every cowboy\nMake them strong as any man\nSomething you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang\nThe heart beat of the heartland\nShe’s got a drawl yall, yeah\nShe’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world\nLet there be cowgirls, come on\n\nLet there be cowgirls\n\nLet there be cowgirls for every cowboy\nMake them strong as any man\nSomething you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang\nThe heart beat of the heartland\nShe’s got a drawl yall, yeah\nShe’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world\nLet there be cowgirls, come on\n\n[Thanks to Jordan, Chynell, Heather, Jillian for corrections]"}
