Ohh\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, baby, come on, baby\nYou knew it was time to just let go\n'Cause we wanna be free\nBut somehow it's just not that easy\nOh, oh, oh, oh, baby\nCome on darlin', now, hear me darlin'\n'Cause you're a waste of time for me\nI'm trying to make you see\nThat baby, you've just got to release me\n\n[Outro]\nRelease me, release me\nRelease me, will you release me?\nAhh, release me\nRelease me, will you release me?"}
