(Me) Why haven't I found another?\nA baller when times get hard i need someone to help me out\nInstead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about\n\nBlaine with the Warblers:\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo you and me are through\n\nBlaine (The Warblers):\nNow you've been (Mmmm) maxing out my card (Card)\nGave me bad (Mmmm) credit buyin' me gifts with my own ends\nHaven't paid the (Mmmm) first bill\nBut instead you're headin' to the mall\nGoin' on shopping sprees (Mmmm)\nPerpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'\n\nAnd then you use (Mmmm) my cell phone (Phone)\nCallin' whoever (Mmmm) that you thinks at home\nAnd then when the (Mmmm) bill comes\nAll of a sudden you be acting dumb\nDon't know where none of (Mmmm) these calls come from\nWhen your momma's number's here more than once\n\nYou trifling (Ling) good for nothing type of brother\nSilly me! (Me) Why haven't I found another?\nA baller when times get hard i need someone to help me out\nInstead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about\n\nBlaine with the Warblers:\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo you and me are through\n\nYou triflin' good for nothing type of brother\nOh silly me why haven't I found another\nYou triflin' good for nothing type of brother\nOh silly me why haven't I found another\n\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills? (Blaine: Pay my telephone, telephone bills)\nIf you did then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo you and me are through\n\nThe Warblers (Blaine):\nCan you pay my bills? (Ohh noo)\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills? (Can you pay my bills)\nIf you did then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do (No, no)\nSo you and me are through"}
