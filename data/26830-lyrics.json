How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI want to feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\nA million shards of glass\nThat haunt me from my past\nAs the stars begin to gather\nAnd the light begins to fade\nWhen all hope begins to shatter\nKnow that I won't be afraid\n\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI want to feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\nThe writing's on the wall\n\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI want to feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\n\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI want to feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on\nThe wall"}
