Handy -- won't you look down over me\nYeah I got a first class ticket\nBut I'm as blue as a boy can be\n\nThen I'm walking in Memphis\nI was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nSaw the ghost of Elvis\nOn Union Avenue\nFollowed him up to the gates of Graceland\nThen I watched him walk right through\nNow security they did not see him\nThey just hovered 'round his tomb\nBut there's a pretty little thing\nWaiting for the King\nDown in the Jungle Room\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThey've got catfish on the table\nThey've got gospel in the air\nAnd Reverend Green be glad to see you\nWhen you haven't got a prayer\nBut boy you've got a prayer in Memphis\n\nNow Muriel plays piano\nEvery Friday at the Hollywood\nAnd they brought me down to see her\nAnd they asked me if I would --\nDo a little number\nAnd I sang with all my might\nAnd she said --\n\"Tell me are you a Christian child?\"\nAnd I said \"Ma'am I am tonight\"\n\n(Chorus)\n\nPut on my blue suede shoes\nAnd I boarded the plane\nTouched down in the land of the Delta Blues\nIn the middle of the pouring rain\nTouched down in the land of the Delta Blues\nIn the middle of the pouring rain\n"}
