Do you see what I see?\nWay up in the sky, little lamb,\nDo you see what I see? Do you see what I see?\nA star, a star, dancing in the night\nWith a tail as big as a kite,\nWith a tail as big as a kite.\"\n\nSaid the little lamb to the shepherd boy,\n\"Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear?\nRinging through the sky, shepherd boy,\nDo you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear?\nA song, a song, high above the trees\nWith a voice as big as the sea,\nWith a voice as big as the sea.\"\n\nSaid the shepherd boy to the mighty king,\n\"Do you know what I know? Do you know what I know?\nIn your palace warm, mighty king,\nDo you know what I know? Do you know what I know?\nA Child, a Child shivers in the cold--\nLet us bring him silver and gold,\nLet us bring him silver and gold.\"\n\nSaid the king to the people everywhere,\n\"Listen to what I say! Listen to what I say!\nPray for peace, people, everywhere,\nListen to what I say! Listen to what I say!\nA Child, A Child sleeping in the night\nHe will bring us goodness and light,\nHe will bring us goodness and light.\"\n\nby ju damian"}
