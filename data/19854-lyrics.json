Oh)\nLike one, two, three\nThe world keeps turning\nOh what a day, what a day, what a day\nThe man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all\nDoes it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall?\nIf we were made in his image, then call us by our names\nMost intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same\n\n[Chorus]\nOh on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOn and on and on and on\nAll night till the vultures swarm\nI go on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOn and on and on and on\nMad props to the God JaBorn\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down\nDon't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure\nI think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning\nOh what a day, what a day, what a day\nYou rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothing left\nThe mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left\nIf we were made in his image, then call us by our names\nMost intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same\n\n[Chorus]\nOh on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh on and on and on, on, on-on, on, on\nYou can't fuck with me, so just leave it alone\nOoh, ooh, wait, on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh on and on and on and on\nAnd on and on"}
