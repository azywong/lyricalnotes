Chase, Monday nights, we made a hobby of it\nStill down with the same dogs, man, they never loved us\nGave my niggas all gold chains to remind me of it\nWe're still holdin' that old thing, tryna rob me of it\nOne time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it\nI'm papi though, they get it poppin' with me when I'm out in public\nFlyin' through, I got a young 'Yonc√© with a Iggy on her\nMe and Metro do the same drugs, got a lot of it\nAll these cups and damn, all these hoes, these niggas up to somethin'\nTouch down out in H-Town, there it might get ugly\nIt's trill niggas, where it's trill niggas, a whole army of 'em\nI run the check up, I'm a hot nigga, don't tell my 'countant on me\nFree Rowdy Rowdy, free Bobby Bobby, them the Shmurda homies\nGood lord!\n\nSundays in the city movin'

in the living room\nI spent racks on these tennis shoes\nNiggas know what I'm finna do\nTime for me to put the mink up\nForgiattos on the Brinks truck\nMy favorite rapper drove a pink truck (Killa!)\nI do shit that you dreamed of\nI was born with a mean mug\nI was born with some nappy hair\nDrinkin' breast milk out a lean cup\nTity Boi's my alias\nReal niggas my radius\nTrill niggas on the song with me\nIf she bad as hell I'll pay the babysitter (I will!)\nIn a black Mercedes with her\nDoin' about 180 with her\nI was born a hustler, paraphernalia in my baby pictures\nResident all eloquent, leather shit in my front yard\nTv by my swimming pool, got that built like a sports bar\nChevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car\nYeah, my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras (Nah!)\nCrib bigger than your imagination\nCall the trap house the gas station\nCall momma's house the Jag station\nEmoji, sad faces\nLook at these niggas\nI need to buy pocketbooks for these niggas\n\nSundays in the city movin' slow\n30 30 3, 500 for the coat\nOnly real niggas keep you float\nOnly trill niggas I know\nOnly trill niggas I know\nOnly trill niggas I
