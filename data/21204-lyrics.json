What's he like?\nAnd will he be\nAnything like the man in his dreams?\n\nShe could see the questions in his eyes\nWhispered:\nDon't be scared my child\nI will let you know what we know about\n\n(CHORUS)\nThe man we found, he looks like you\nWho cried and said he never knew\nAbout the boy in pictures that we showed him\n\nA rambler in his younger days\nHe knew he made a few mistakes\nBut he swore he would have been there\nHad he known it\n\nYou always said this was something that you wanted\nSon it's time to meet your dad in Oklahoma\n\nOne last turn he held his breath\nTill they reached the fifth house on the left\nAnd all at once\nThe tears came rollin' in\n\nAnd as they pulled in to the drive\nThe man was waiting there outside\nWiped the worry from his eyes\nSmiled and took his hand\n\nAnd he said:\n\n(CHORUS)\nI'm the man who looks like you\nWho cried because I never knew\nAbout the boy in pictures that they showed me\n\nA rambler in my younger days\nI know I made a few mistakes\nBut I swear I would have been there\nHad I known it\n\nNever again will you ever be alone\nSon, welcome to your home\nIn Oklahoma"}
