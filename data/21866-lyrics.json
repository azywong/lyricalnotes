No...\n\nI am aware now of how\nEverything's gonna be fine one day\nToo late, I'm in hell I am prepared now,\nSeems everyone's gonna be fine\nOne day too late, just as well\n\nI am prepared now,\nSeems everyone's gonna be fine\nfor me, for me, for myself (3x)\n\nI am prepared now, for myself\nI am prepared now,\nAnd I am fine again."}
