Can I get a righteous \nAs kids, we saw and we did what most kids never did \nTook my first swig chilling at my homies crib \nSearching for ways, so that we could make presidents \nLife was hard beign a product of my residence \nBut me beign the youngest, I had to stay strong \nMom's was my teacher cause Pop's was already gone \nHung out in the streets doing my own thing \nLiving in the barrio, but I never gangbanged \nComing up was a must, growing up with who I grew up \nI found out just who I can trust \nMe, Myself, and I not fronting like a phony \nI'm true to the game and I'm down with my homies \n\nChorus \n\nVerse: 3 ( ODM,DTTX ) \n\nYou wanna be my homie well hey I'll tell you something \nHanging with my crew doesn't really mean nothing \nBlabbing when I get all toured doing my songs \nYou gonna want to kick it, well listen up here holmes \nIt goes way back before you ever knew me \nI hung with my friends and not male groupies \nJust goes to show everybody where I'm coming from \nHey yo! D' break em off something \n\n( DTTX ) \nSo many people wanna hang now that I'm in the rap game \nThey say that they're down when they dont even know my name \nWell I could say that I have many friends \nBut a homie is true, through and through until the end \nAnd ain't a damn thing changed \nWe're still hanging in the hood and doing the same thangs \nCause I ain't one to be a phony \nI'm still true to the game and I'm down with my homies \n\nChorus"}
