It sure is a nice night\nHow â€˜bout a little test-drive, down by the lake?\nThereâ€™s a place I know about, where the dirt road runs out\nWe can try out the four-wheel drive\nCome on now whataâ€™ ya say? Girl I can hardly wait-\nTo get a little mud on the tires\n\nCause itâ€™s a good night, to be out there soakinâ€™ up the moonlight\nSteak out a little piece of shoreline, I got the perfect place in mind\nItâ€™s in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there\nGotta get a little mud on the tires\n\nMoonlight on a duck vine, catfish on a trout line\nSun sets about nine, this time of year\nWe can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background\nAnd more stars than you can count on a night this clear\nTell ya what we need to do, grab a sleepinâ€™ bag or two\nAnd build us a little campfire\nThen with a little luck, we might just get stuck\nLets get a little mud on the tires\n\nCause itâ€™s a good night, to be out there soakinâ€™ up the moonlight\nSteak out a little piece of shoreline, I got the perfect place in mind\nItâ€™s in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there\nGotta get a little mud on the tires\n\nThen with a little luck, we might just get stuck\nLets get a little mud on the tires\n\n\n"}
