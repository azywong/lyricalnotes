Yea baby ready or not\"\n\nI just smiled but I was scared to death\nHow am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?\n\n(CHORUS)\nWoah in a real love\nYeah yeah\nIts a real love\n\n(CHORUS)\nYeah baby its a real love\nYeah its a real love baby\nYeah its a real, real, real, real, real, real love\nWhoa"}
