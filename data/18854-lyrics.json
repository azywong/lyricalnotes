Goode\r\nLooking so sweet it oughta be a crime\r\nShe plays with my heart and messes with my mind\r\nActs like Madonna but she listens to Merle\r\nRock my world little Country girl\r\n\r\nShe wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein\r\nAnd cheap sunglasses from the five and dime\r\nAll the other girls in school they give her dirty looks\r\nShe got an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in math and never cracked a book\r\nSure looks good in her denim and pearls\r\nRock my world little Country girl\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nRock my world\r\nDrag me out on the floor\r\nDance with me till I can't dance anymore\r\nOne-step, two-step, get in a line\r\nI gotta find a way to make you mine\r\n\r\nI tell her that I love her but it ain't enough\r\nShe says I got to learn to loosen up\r\nGet a little wild on Saturday night\r\nBut make sure she's home before the mornin' light\r\nSunday she's all ribbons and curls\r\nRock my world little Country girl\r\n\r\n(Repeat chorus)\r\n\r\nRock my world little Country girl"}
