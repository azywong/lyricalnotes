Thank your unlucky stars\nNo, you're never quite happy right where you are\n\nSo you keep on, inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nNo there are none\nYeah you, keep on inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nYou don't even see the sun\nCan't you see the sun?\n\nYou can't be shocked that I might want to leave\nThe way you're living's like you're half asleep\nYou just drain me\nIf I go, who could blame me?\n\nAnd you stare out the window with the passing cars\nAnd you look at the sky. Thank your unlucky stars\nNo, you're never quite happy right where you are\nRight where you are\nWith all that you are\n\nSo you keep on, inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nNo there are none\nYeah you, keep on inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nYou don't even see the sun\nCan't you see the sun?\n\nYou're so young\nSo beautiful\nSo flawless in my eyes\nDon't you know the world shines\nEvery time you smile\nWhy can't you just smile?\n\nSo you keep on, inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nNo there are none\nYeah you, keep on inventing shadows\nWhere there are none\nYou don't even see the sun\nCan't you see the sun?\n\nYou dim the lights in the world I see\nHow I wish that I could still believe\nTime to save me\nIf I go, who could blame me?"}
