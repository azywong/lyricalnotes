You know how we do man!\n\n(Chorus)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\n\n(Verse 1)\nStraight up, you's a bad ass, baby you hot\nIn the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block\nThats the reason you mujers got me, believe it or not\nMe and you can run the world like Biggie and Pac\nCause you my main homie, my main shorty\nCock back hammers and bang homie, protecting our gauge slowly\nWith a girl like you, forget the nonsense\nWe'll be the most talked about like the chicos and gossip\nDime!\n(Daddy Yankee is shining right now)\nCome on cop me now, I got this game locked down\nWhat you know about big things, strong wheels, strong bills\nMe and you holding it down, its so real\nCome On!\n\n(Chorus)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\n\n(Verse 2)\nYo!  La negra tiene tumbao\nCuando camina de'lao\nPor la calle ocho sin miedo we be wildin out\nSwitching lanes on the freeway, corriendo por miles\nA little four play like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen\nTouching you is not a felony\nHow am I a playa, ma?   \nDo I look like Bill Bellamy?\nNo te molestes yo soy tuyo na' mas\nI'm not a player, I just crush a lot\n\nTu eres la chica ideal para mi (All I want is a girl like you)\nComo tu nadie nadie me a hecho sentir (All I want is a girl like you)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\n\nO! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you)\nO! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you)\nO! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you)\nO! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you)\n\n(Chorus)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\nCause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)\nIt's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)\n\nYeah!\nAll my Latinos stand up!\nCaminen conmigo!\nOn the floor bussing\nDaddy Yankee!  Barrio Fino!\nAnd I'm proud to be Latin man.\nLetting you know this is real.\nLuny Tunes"}
