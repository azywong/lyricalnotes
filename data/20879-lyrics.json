My last album was The Chronic\nThey want to know if he still got it\nThey say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it\n(If you ain't up on thangs)\nDr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game\nStill puffin' my leaves\nStill fuck with the beats, still not lovin' police\nStill rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease\nStill got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)\nStill the beats bang, still doin' my thang\nSince I left ain't too much changed, still…\n\n[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nSince the last time you heard from me I lost some friends\nWell, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again\nKept my ear to the streets\nSigned Eminem, he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week\nStill, I stay close to the heat\nAnd even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet\nMy life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat\nTreat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep\nWake up in the A.M., compose a beat\nI bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat\nIt's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth\nSince 'Turn Out the Lights' from the World Class Wreckin Cru\nI'm still at it, after mathematics\nIn the home of drive-by's and ak-matics\nSwap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic\nI dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.\n\n[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nIt ain't nothin' but more hot shit\nAnother classic CD for y'all to vibe with\nWhether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch\nLaid back in the shack, play this track\nI'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world\nStill (hittin' them corners on the lo-lo's, girl)\nI'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap\nNiggas try to be the king, but the ace is back\n(So if you ain't up on thangs)\nDr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game\nStill got it wrapped like a mummy\nStill ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money\nSpend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood\nHit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard\nBarbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars\nStill gon' get mine regardless\n\n[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\nI'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world\nStill hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl\n(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat\nAnd I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)\n\n[Outro: Snoop Dogg]\nRight back up in your mothafuckin' ass\n9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up\nD-R-E right back up on top of thangs\nSmoke some with your dog\nNo stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!\nSome of that real sticky icky icky\nOoh wee! Put it in the air! Oh, you's a fool D.R."}
