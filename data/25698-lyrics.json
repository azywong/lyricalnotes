Was she an actress?\"\nBaby the fact is\n\nYou're hearing rumours about me\nAnd saw some pictures online\nSaying they got you so angry\nMaking you wish you were blind\nBefore we start talking crazy\nSaying some things we'll regret\nCan we just slow it down and press reset\nYou're beautiful\n\nSo please babe\nSo please don't judge me\nAnd I won't judge you\n'Cause it could get ugly\nBefore it gets beautiful\nPlease don't judge me\nAnd I won't judge you\nAnd if you love me\nThen let it be beautiful\n\nJust let the past\nJust be the past\nAnd focused on things\nThat are gonna make us laugh\nTake me as I am, not who I was\nI'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust\n\nSo please babe\nSo please don't judge me\nAnd I won't judge you\n'Cause it could get ugly\nBefore it gets beautiful\nPlease don't judge me\nAnd I won't judge you\nAnd if you love me\nThen let it be beautiful\nLet it be beautiful \nLet it be beautiful \nLet it be beautiful \nLet it be beautiful \nLet it be beautiful ay\nLet it be beautiful yeah \n\nI don't wanna go there baby yeah\nWe should never go there"}
