Hosein, D. Deviller\n\nVerse\nThe snow is falling, the city is white\nYour eyes are shining like diamonds tonight\nAnd we're all alone, there's no one home\nYou're finally in my arms again\nThe night is silent and Christmas is here\nI couldn't ask for more than having you near\n'Cause I love you, girl, I always will\nAnd now I know the moment is right\nThe moment is right \n\nChorus\nI've been waiting to give this gift tonight\nI'm down on my knees, there's no better time\nIt's something to last for as long as you live\nTonight I'm gonna give you (oh, girl) all my heart can give \n\nVerse\nI thought I'd give you something shiny and new\nI tried to find something worthy of you\nBut I realized when I looked inside\nThere's some things that money can't buy (oh, no)\nI feel the magic whenever you're near\nI feel it even more this time of the year\n'Cause I love you, girl, I always will\nAnd now I know the moment is right\nThe moment is right \n\nChorus \n\nBridge\nYou know I'll always be true to you\nAnd you know I'm the one you can turn to\nAny time, any place, or anywhere\nYou know that I'll always be there \n\nChorus \n"}
