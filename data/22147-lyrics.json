(so tell me)\nWhat would it take\nTo make you see that I'm alive?\n\nIf I was invisible (invisible...invisible...)\nThen I could just\nWatch you in your room\nIf I was invisible\nI'd make you mine tonight\nIf hearts were unbreakable\nThen I could just\nTell you where I stand\nI would be the smartest man\nIf I was invisible\nWait, I already am\n\nSaw your face in the crowd\nI call out your name\nYou don't hear a sound\nI keep tracing your steps\nEach move that you make\nWish I could be\nWhat goes through your mind (oh baby)\nWish you could touch me\nWith the colours of your life\n\nIf I was invisible (yea...yea..)\nThen I could just\nWatch you in your room\nIf I was invisible\nI'd make you mine tonight\nIf hearts were unbreakable\nThen I could just\nTell you where I stand\nI would be the smartest man\nIf I was invisible\nWait, I already am\n\nI'd make you mine tonight (invisible...)\nI'd make you mine tonight\n\nI reach out\nYou don't even see me\nEven when I scream out\nBaby, you don't hear me (you don't hear me)\nI am nothing without you\nJust a shadow passing through (invisible...invisible...invisible...invisible...)\nOooo....\n\nIf I was invisible (whoa.....)\nThen I could just\nWatch you in your room\nIf I was invisible\nI'd make you mine tonight (I would make you mine)\nIf hearts were unbreakable (hearts broke...)\nThen I could just\nTell you where I stand\nI would be the smartest man\nIf I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)\nIf I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)\nIf I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)\nIf I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)\nIf I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)"}
