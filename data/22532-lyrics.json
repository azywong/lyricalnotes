A kiss with opened eyes.\nAnd she's not breathing back.\nAnything but bother me.\n(It takes my pain away)\nNevermind these are horrid times.\nOh oh oh\nI can't let it bother me.\n\nI never thought I'd walk away from you.\nI did.\nBut it's a false sense of accomplishment.\nEverytime time I quit\n\nAnyone can see my every flaw.\nIt isn't hard.\nAnyone can say they're above this all.\nIt takes my pain away.\n\nIt's a lie. A kiss with opened eyes.\nAnd she's not breathing back.\nAnything but bother me.\n(It takes my pain away)\nNevermind these are horrid times.\nOh oh oh\nI can't let it bother me.\n\nI can't let it bother me.\n\nIt takes my pain away,\nIt's a lie. A kiss with opened eyes,\nAnd she's not breathing back,\nAnything but bother me,\n(It takes my pain away)\nNevermind these are horrid times\nOh oh oh\nI can't let it bother me\nIt takes my pain,\nIt takes my pain,\nIt takes my pain,\nIt takes my pain away."}
