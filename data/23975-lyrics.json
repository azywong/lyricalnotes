Ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\nDid I wake you? Were you sleepin'? Were you still in the bed?\nOr is a nightmare keepin' you up instead?\nOh baby, are you feelin' guilty for what you did?\nIf you think you're hurtin' you ain't seen nothin' yet\n\nWas it really worth it?\nWas she everything\nThat you were lookin' for?\nFeel like a man\nI hope you know that\nYou can't come back\n'Cause all we had\nIs broken like shattered glass\n\nYou're gonna see me in your dreams tonight\nMy face is gonna haunt you all the time\nI promise that you gon' want me back\nWhen your world falls apart like shattered glass\nGlass, glass, glass...\n\nAre you havin' trouble focusing throughout the day?\nDo you find yourself still calling my name?\nDo you wish you could rewind time and take it back?\nI bet you realized that she ain't half the woman I am\n\nWas it really worth it?\nWas she everything\nThat you were lookin' for?\nFeel like a man\nI hope you know that\nYou can't come back\n'Cause all we had\nIs broken like shattered glass\n\nYou're gonna see me in your dreams tonight\nMy face is gonna haunt you all the time\nI promise that you gon' want me back\nWhen your world falls apart like shattered glass\nGlass, glass, glass, glass, glass, glass, glass\n\nOoh... Ooh... Ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh... Ooh... Ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh"}
