If this is Austin, I still love you\n\nWell, this time she left her number\nBut not another word\nThen she waited by the phone on Sunday evenin'\nAnd this is what he heard\n\nIf you're callin' 'bout my heart\nIt's still yours\nI should've listened to it a little more\nThen it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong\nAnd by the way, boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to\nCan't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you\n\nI still love you\n \n"}
