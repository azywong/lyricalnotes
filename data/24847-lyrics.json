What if? What if?\nWhat if? What if? What if?\n\nYeah, picture me on one knee\nWith the perfect diamond ring\nWe just met but if you said yes\nWe'd have our wedding on the beach\n\nIt could happen, raise three kids\nAnd we grow old oh, so happily\nI know this may sound crazy\n'Cause I don't know your name\n\nBut we can't, we can't tell the future, no\nBut that's just the beauty of the world we know\nSo I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?\nWe all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?\n\nDon't know what tomorrow brings\nBut I'm still hoping that you are the one for me\nOh, and what if I had you and what if you had me\nAnd, baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?\n\nWhat if? What if? What if?\nWhat if? What if?\n\nBut we can't, we can't tell the future, no\nBut that's just the beauty of the world we know\nSo I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?\nWe all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?\n\nBut we can't, we can't tell the future, no\nBut that's just the beauty of the world we know\nSo I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?\nWe all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if?"}
