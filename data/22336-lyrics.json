You got a phone\nPick it up, call me\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nHow come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more\nWe don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more\nAnd I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now\nAfter all the years we've been down\nAin't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true\nWe family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nWe were so young so full of life and vibrance\nSide by side, wherever you was riding, I went\nSo close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit\nWhen Ronnie died you was right by my side\nWith a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes\nAnd a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it\nYou even had the same type of childhood I did\nSometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours\nAnd mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it\nWe grew up, grew apart as time went by us\nAnd I blew up to both yours and mines surprises\nNow I feel a vibe I just can't describe it\nMuch as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice\nAnd your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\n[Verse 2: Kon Artis]\nIt was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse\nOn my own album with a deal but shit got worse\n'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first\nFor I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome\nBitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit\nBut you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit\nI told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her\nComing outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk\nLike y'all was husband and wife or something\nBut me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something\nCause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me\nWhen all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty\nAnd ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced\nYou acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose\nBut I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth\nDon't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\n[Verse 3: Proof]\nIt gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop\nNow we acting like I gotta live only for the block\nAnd homies in the hood only see me on the tube\nSo they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude\nFools I used to rap wit all expect magic\nLike my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen\nBut Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown\nShady made it so my babies ain't starving at home\nSee the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends\nForever real intelligence that's forever till the end\nI peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies\nAin't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise\n(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?\n(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?\nAnd every time I go to hear you play, you look away\nWe barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face\n\n[Hook: Eminem]"}
