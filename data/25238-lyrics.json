I ain't shittin' roses\nWe in in the same picture but we all got different poses\n\nI'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it\nI try to slow down, and I get rear ended\nPause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!\nHighway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?\n\nThey say \"you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it\"\nWell call me clueless cause I do this\nAttention all shooters, I'm a shooting star\nLife is a course and imma shoot for par\n\nI'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow\nAnd I put that shit right back like I'll see what I find tomorrow\nYoung Money CMR, I'm blood like a scar\nI'm Weezy F baby and the F ain't for \"Flaw\"\n\nIt's like I have it all\nBut I don't have to worry\nMarried to the money, a true love story\nOnly God can judge me, I don't need a jury\nNothing standing in my way, like nothings my security\nBack to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me\nI knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney\n\nIf you sleeping on me, than I hope you toss and turning\nI'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo girl she will confirm it\nYeah\nNow what we doing with it\nYou keep opening ya grill, I'm barbecuing with it\nI know my shit already tight so I ain't screwing with it\nSome say this shit is a joke well I hope they get it\nOk, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point\nYeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice\nI'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser\nAnd don't call me sir, call me survivor\nYeah\n\nAnd I ain't doing nothin' but getting my share\nBreathin' this air\nIf Miss Rochelle told me she gon keep me in her prayers\nSo I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware\nAnd if you wanna trip than imma meet ya there\nTo my niggas in the game, keep the game fair\nPlayers play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer\nI'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear\nWeezy F baby and the F ain't for \"Fear\"\nUhhh"}
