Go!\n\nCrushing metal, Ripping Skin\nTossing body, mannequin\nSpilling Blood, Bleeding Gas\n\nMangle flesh, Snapping spine\nDripping bloody valentine\nShatter face, spitting glass\n\nSplit apart\nSplit apart\nSplit apart\nSplit\nSpit it out!\n\nWhat makes me drift a litter bit closer?\nDead man takes the steering wheel.\nWhat makes me know it's time to cross over?\nBorn to repeat until i feel.\n\nSee through the skin, bones they all rattle\nFuture and past, they disagree.\nFlesh falls away, bones they all shatter\nI start to see the end in me\n\nSee the end in me...\n\nClaustrophobic\nClimb out of this skin\nHeart explosive\nReach in, pull that pin\n\nViolate, annihilate\nAll wounds unto my eyes\nObliterate, exterminate\naAs life itself denied\n\nFear thy name as hell awakens\nDestiny Inhale the Fire\n\nBut we've crossed that line\nInto the grips\nTotal eclipse\nSuffer unto my apocalypse\n\nTyrant awaken my apocalypse.\nDemon awaken my apocalypse.\nHeaven awaken my apocalypse.\nSuffer forever my apocalypse."}
