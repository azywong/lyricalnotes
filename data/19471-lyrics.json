Dawn","spotify_id":null,"lyrics":"There are only whispers and shadows for me\nThe way things are and the way things are\nAnd with this I blow a kiss to disaster\nBecause I wish to perfect my heart...\nI gotta check my mind...\nAm I in tune with you?\nDo we connect within the realm of the gods?\nElectric word \"life\" that means forever\nAnd thats a mighty long time when you've kissed divine\nSo divine...as with you\nThe Christ within will come in the clouds\nTrusting \"divinity is always with me\"\nTrusting \"this is the here and now\"\nMercy's right...I gotta check my love\nAnd I'm trying to do as such\nI don't let the demons get me down\nIt's just that sometimes I miss you so much...\n\nI can envision all things to life\nI can understand realistic ways\nBut I invent the next phase in forever\nI like you, rewrite the next page\nIt's so pristine...it's so untouched\nI'm an emmaculate sign of devotion\nStill unseen...I'm thinking so what\nBless me cursed with colorful emotions\nGod said \"I guess you don't know I'm you\nBecause you know the entire 360\"\nA Christ that's me\nA Christ that's you\nReguardless...constantly within me\nI'm so not responsible for this\nI'm just a man in love with so much\nI know love...you'll always be with me\nIt's just sometimes I miss you so much"}
