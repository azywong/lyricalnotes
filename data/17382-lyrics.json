Oh, he did everything right\nHe brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily\nAnd in the morning when he woke\nall I left him was a note\nI told him I am the flower you are the seed\nWe walked in the garden we planted a tree\nDon't try to find me, please don't you dare\nJust live in my memory, you'll always be there\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI've got lovin' arms to hold on to\n\nOh, ooh, we made love\nLove like strangers\nAll night long\nWe made love\n\nThen it happened one day, we came round the same way\nYou can imagine his surprise\nwhen he saw his own eyes\nI said please, please understand\nI'm in love with another man\nAnd what he couldn't give me\nOhh, oh, oh was the one little thing that you can\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I want to do is make love to you\nCome on, say you will, you want me too\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I want to do is make love to you\nSay you will baby, you want me too\n\nAll night long\n\nAll I wanna do\nAll I wanna do\nAll I wanna do\nAll I wanna do\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew"}
