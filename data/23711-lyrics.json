Hell is so close and heavens out of reach\nI ain’t given up quite yet. I got too much to lose\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low and ill carry u home\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down\nAnd ill carry you home\n\n(ohhh ohhh ohhh)\n\nWind is gonna fall, sun is gonna shine\nWind is gonna blow, waters gonna rise\nShe said. Win the day comes, welcome to my eyes\nNo ones given up quite yet we got too much to lose\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low and ill carry you home\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down\nAnd ill carry you all the way\nWhen you say your fine, But your still young, and out of line\nAnd ill I need, Is to turn around\nTo make you last, to make you count\nGone away, make the same mistakes\nThat put my momma in her grave\nDon’t wanna be alone\n\nHold me down.\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down.\nSweet and low and ill carry you home\n\nHold me down\nSweet and low little girl\n\nHold me down\nAnd ill carry you home\n\n(Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)"}
