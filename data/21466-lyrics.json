Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nAnnie, are you ok? Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nAnnie, are you ok? Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nAnnie, are you ok? Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?!\n\nAnnie, are you ok?\nWill you tell us that you're ok?\nThere's a sign on the window\nThat he struck you (a crescendo, Annie)\nHe came into your apartment\nLeft the bloodstains on the carpet\nThen you ran into the bedroom\nYou were struck down\nIt was your doom\n\nAnnie, are you ok? Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nAnnie, are you ok? Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nAnnie, are you ok?

Are you ok?\nAre you ok, Annie?\nYou've been hit by\nYou've been struck by\nA smooth criminal\n\nAnnie, are you ok?\nWill you tell us that you're ok?\nThere's a sign on the window\nThat he struck you (a crescendo, Annie)\nHe came into your apartment\nLeft the bloodstains on the carpet\nThen you ran into the bedroom\nYou were struck down\nIt was your doom"}
