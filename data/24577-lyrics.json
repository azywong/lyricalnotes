Yo, I don't know\nTurn off the lights, and I'll glow\nTo the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal\nLight up a stage and wax a chump like a candle\n\nDance, bum rush a speaker that booms\nI'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom\nDeadly, when I play a dope melody\nAnything less that the best is a felony\nLove it or leave it, you better gain way\nYou better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play\nIf there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\nIce Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\n\nNow that the party is jumping\nWith the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'\nQuick to the point, to the point no faking\nCooking MC's like a pound of bacon\nBurning 'em if you ain't quick and nimble\nI go crazy when I hear a cymbal\nAnd a high hat with a souped up tempo\nI'm on a roll and it's time to go solo\nRollin in my five-point-oh\nWith my ragtop down so my hair can blow\nThe girlies on standby, waving just to say hi\nDid you stop? No, I just drove by\nKept on pursuing to the next stop\nI bust a left and I'm heading to the next block\nThat block was dead, yo, so I continued to A1A\nBeachfront Avenue!\n\nGirls were hot wearing less than bikinis\nRockman lovers driving Lamborghinis\nJealous 'cause I'm out getting mine\nShay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine\nReadying for the chumps on the wall\nThe Chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls\nGunshots rang out like a bell, I grabbed my nine\nAll I heard were shells\nFallin' on the concrete real fast\nJumped in my car, slammed on the gas\nBumper-to-bumper the avenue's packed\nI'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack\nPolice on the scene, you know what I mean\nThey passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends\nIf there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\nIce Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\n\nTake heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet\nMiami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it\nMy town, that created all the bass sound\nEnough to shake and kick holes in the ground\n'Cause my style's like a chemical spill\nFeasible rhymes that you can vision and feel\nConducted and formed, that's a hell of a concept\nWe make it hype and you want to step with this\nShay plays on the fade, sliced like a ninja\nCut like a razor blade so fast, other DJ's say, \"Damn\"\nIf my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram\nKeep my composure when it's time to get loose\nMagnetized by the mic while I kick my juice\nIf there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it!\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\nIce Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nVanilla Ice Ice Baby\nToo cold, too cold\nIce, ice, ice...\n\nYo man, let's get out of here\nWord to your mother"}
