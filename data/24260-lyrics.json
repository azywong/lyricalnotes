I'll be a runaway (be a runaway, be a runaway)\n\nA hundred miles in I got a stupid grin on my scruffly face\nWith every cigarette I'm burnin' my regret Don't wanna leave a trace\nAnd from the rearview I've got a clear view of who I used to be\nA little bit faster now don't wanna turn around\n\nI'm gonna pack my bags and never look back\nRun a parallel with the railroad tracks ohh And make my getaway\nI'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight(ohh)\nAt the break of day I'll be a runaway (be a runaway, be a runaway) I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway be a runaway)\n\nIt's crazy I know to count on this road to give me what I need\nBut with every state line\nSomehow I find another part of me yeah yeah\n\n(instrumental)\n\nI'm gonna pack my bags and never look back\nRun a parallel line with the railroad tracks ohh\nAnd make my getaway\nI'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down\nLeave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight ohh\nAnd at the break of day I'll be a runaway"}
