Wake up!\nOn a saturday night\nCould be New York\nMaybe Hollywood and vine\nLondon, Paris maybe Tokyo\nSomething's going on\nAnywhere I go tonight, tonight\nYeah tonight!\n\nThe city's restless\nIt's all around me\nPeople in motion\nSick of all the same routines\nAnd they need to go\nThey need to get away tonight!\n\nI put my make up on saturday night\nI try to make it happen\nTry make it alright\nI know I make mistakes\nI'm living life day to day\nIt's never realy easy\nBut it's ok\n\nChorus:\nWake up! Wake up!\nOn a saturday night\nCould be New York\nMaybe Hollywood and vine\nLondon, Paris maybe Tokyo\nSomething's going on\nAnywhere I go tonight, tonight\nYeah tonight!\n\nPeople all around you\nEverywhere that you go\nPeople all around you\nThey don't really know you\nEverybody is watching\nLike it's some kind of show\nEverybody is watching\nThey don't really know you now\n(They don't really know you)\n(They don't really know you)\nAnd forever\n\nWake up! Wake up!\nWake up! Wake up!\nWake up! Wake up!\nWake up! Wake up!\n\nWake up! Wake up!\nOn a saturday night\nCould be New York\nMaybe Hollywood and vine\nLondon, Paris maybe Tokyo\nSomething's going on\nAnywhere I go...\n\nWake up! Wake up!\nOn a saturday night\nCould be New York\nMaybe Hollywood and vine\nLondon, Paris maybe Tokyo\nSomething's going on\nAnywhere I go tonight, tonight\nYeah tonight!"}
