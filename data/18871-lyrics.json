Everyone for the rest of your life there's a girl fucking tight!\nLadies! All everyone there's a man who is tight who can hit it all night!\nWe gotta get the pumps!\n\nChorus(4x)\n\nI don't like 'em stiggity fat! (No!)\nI like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)\nYou wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)\nSo when you hear the rump shaking on the dance floor\nKeep you bottling get your eyes and get hypnotized\nBut a nigga like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing\nKeep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing\nI put my fingerprints all over that rump\nI'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)\n\nChorus (4x)\nBridge"}
