Dot ring, Chandon for my crew\nBad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two\nGunplay he a glue, goon with a attitude, holla\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nSwimmin' in women, champagne sippin'\nGold emblem with, two M's in it\nThis pimpin' is so magnificent\nStop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!\nOh I, I can show you\nShow you better than I can tell you\nOh I, I can show you\nOh I, oh I, oh I\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nI'm the Magnificent with a sensational style\nWhen I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile\nNigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial\nYeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound\n\"Sak pase\" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town\nAll them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down\nMoney is a must, tommy guns on a bus\nAllan Zamren on the case, so you know what you could suck\nWear red all the time, but really I'm color blind\nWanna catch my attention nigga? Throw up a dollar sign\nOne time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs\nAnd I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'\nThe game never change, money still a focal\nBut it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total\nLike Rev Run in the tub, still smokin'\nIn memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nSwimmin' in women, champagne sippin'\nGold emblem with, two M's in it\nThis pimpin' is so magnificent\nStop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!\nOh I, I can show you\nShow you better than I can tell you\nOh I, I can show you\nOh I, oh I, oh I"}
