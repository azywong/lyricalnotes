I should have played you\nCause you don't appreciate me, no\nAnd I tried to stay down with you\nBut you're making it hard for me\n\n(Chorus)\nAs much as you accused me of cheatin'\nI should have cheated\nAs much as you accused me of lying\nAs much as you accused me of clubbin'\n(I love you)\nAs much as you accused me of cheatin'\nI should have cheated"}
