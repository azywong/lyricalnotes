You can never look back.\"\nI thought I knew what love was\nWhat did I know?\nThose days are gone forever\nI should just let them go but\n\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nYou got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby\nAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone\n\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nYou got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby\nI can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone"}
