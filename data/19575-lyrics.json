Stevenson)\r\n\r\nMy Maria don't you know I've come a long, long way\r\nI been longin' to see her\r\nWhen she's around she takes my blues away\r\nSweet Maria the sunlight surely hurts my eyes\r\nI'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies\r\n\r\nMaria, Maria I love you\r\n\r\nMy Maria there were some blue and sorrow times\r\nJust my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind\r\nGypsy lady you're a miracle work for me\r\nYou set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea\r\nShe is the sunlight when the skies are grey\r\nShe treats me so right lady take me away\r\n\r\nMy Maria\r\nMaria I love you\r\nMy Maria\r\nMaria I love you\r\n\r\nMy Maria\r\nMaria I love you"}
