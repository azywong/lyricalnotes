Yes I am\nFresh like \"damn, this nigga did it again\nA hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim\"\nInside the Lambo, the shotgun with Snoop\nWhat would the muthafuckin' West Coast be without one crip and\n\n[Hook: Junior Reid]\nOne blood (x4)\nBlood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood (x3)\nOne blood (x4)\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm from the West side of the '64 Impala\nWhere niggas say \"Where you from?\" We ain't never say \"Holler\"\nBandanna on the right side, gun on the left side\nNiggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside\nWord to Eazy\nI'm so ill, believe me\nI made room for Jeezy\nBut the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing\nAll I need is one reason\nI'm the king, and Dre said the West Coast need me\nI don't know why you niggas keep trying me\nEverybody knows I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty\nAnd I ain't gotta make shit for the club\nWhat DJ gonna turn down the thirty-eight snub?\nYou thirty-eight and you still rapping? Urgh\nI'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs\nOn the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards\nWhen the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is -\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay\nWhat's beef when you getting head in the six-tre?\nAnd the double Game-Chain, I keep 'em on display\nBlack T-shirt, so all you see is the A\nTurn on the TV, and all you see is the A\nYou niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play\nKeep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away\nI don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say\nAnd niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop\nI got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock\nNo beam, no silencer - I know when to pop\nWait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot\nI have the number one billboard spot\nNiggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top\nI'm B.I.G, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac\nThis ain't shit but a warning till my album drop\n\n[Hook]"}
