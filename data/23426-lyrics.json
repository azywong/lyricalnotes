It was never my intention to brag\nTo steal it all away from you now\nBut God does it feel so good\n'Cause I got him where I want him right now\nAnd if you could then you know you would\n'Cause God it just feels so...\nIt just feels so good ...\n\nI watched his wildest dreams come true\nNot one of them involving you\nJust watch my wildest dreams come true\nNot one of them involving ...\n\nWell I never meant to brag\nBut I got him where I want him now\nOh! It was never my intention to brag\nTo steal it all away from you now\nBut God does it feel so good\n'Cause I got him where I want him now\nAnd if you could then you know you would\n'Cause God it just feels so...\nIt just feels so good"}
