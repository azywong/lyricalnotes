Make all my screws come... loose\nGot me perfectly con... fused\nAlways to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild\nI love the way you make me lose my mind\nLose my mind\n\n\nYou make me crazy and I kinda like it\nYou show me that apple girl snd I want to bite it\nSo crazy that I gotta have it, and\nI never wanna get out of this straitjacket\n\n\nYou... Make all my screws come... loose\nGot me perfectly con... fused\nAlways to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild\nI love the way you make me lose my\n\n\nI feel the walls closing in inside this padded room\nOnly good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you, yeah\nI'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next\nBut my favorite part about it is I always have to guess (you know I do)\n\n\nYou... Make all my screws come... loose\nGot me perfectly con... fused\nAlways to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild\nI love the way you make me lose my mind\nMake me Lose my mind\nLose my mind\nMake me lose my mind\nLose my mind"}
