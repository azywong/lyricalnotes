I was always thinking...\nI was always thinking... I was always thinking...\nI was always thinking... I was always thinking...\nI was always thinking...\n\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing\nI was always thinking... I was always thinking...\nI was always thinking... I was always thinking... I... I... I... I...\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing\nI was always thinking of games that I was playing"}
