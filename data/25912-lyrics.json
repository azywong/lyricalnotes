Don't touch anything in the store?\nAnd there's rich nigga racism\nThat's that? Come here, please buy more?\nWhat you want a Bentley, fur coat \nand diamond chain?\nAll you blacks want all the same things\nUsed to only be niggas \nnow everybody play me\nSpending everything on Alexander Wang\nNew Slaves\n\n[Hook]\nYou see it's leaders and there's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\n\nYou see it's leaders and there's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\n\n[Verse 2]\nI throw these Maybach keys\nI wear my heart on the sleeve\nI know that we the new slaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI know that we the new slaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nThey throwing hate at me\nWant me to stay at ease\nFuck you and your corporation\nY'all niggas can't control me\nI know that we the new slaves\nI know that we the new slaves\nI'm about to wild the fuck out\nI'm going Bobby Boucher\nI know that pussy ain't free\nYou niggas pussy, ain't me\nY'all throwing contracts at me\nYou know that niggas can't read\nThrow on some Maybach keys\nFuck it, \"c'est la vie\"\nI know that we the new slaves\nY'all niggas can't fuck with me\nY'all niggas can't fuck with Ye\nY'all niggas can't fuck with Ye\nI'll move my family out the country\nSo you can't see where I stay\nSo go and grab the reporters\nSo I can smash their recorders\nSee they'll confuse us\n with some bullshit like the New World Order\nMeanwhile the Dea\nTeamed up with the Cca\nThey tryna lock niggas up\nThey tryna make new slaves\nSee that's that private owned prison\nGet your piece today\nThey Probably all in the Hamptons\nBraggin' 'bout their maid\nFuck you and your Hampton house\nI'll fuck your Hampton spouse\nCame on her Hampton blouse\nAnd in her Hampton mouth\nY'all 'bout to turn shit up\nI'm 'bout to tear shit down\nI'm 'bout to air shit out\nNow what the fuck they gon' say now?"}
