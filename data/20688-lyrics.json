Just trying to get the job done\nAt the end of the day I'm overworked and underpaid\nI can't get enough\n\nWhen the week is done I like to have some fun. I can't get enough\nYou can find me hanging out where the music's turned loud\nI can't get enough\nYeah I'm lookin' for a guy who can light up my night\nIt don't even have to be love\nA little huggin' and kissin', I'm a girl on a mission\nCan't get enough\n\nWe only get one time around\nYou better get it while you can\nIf you let this old world go and get you down life will slip right through your hands\n\nSo bring on the laughter and bring on the tears\nI can't get enough\nIt's a race against time\nJust want to live 'til I die\nI can't get enough\nYeah I'm going to take my turn\nGonna love, gonna learn\nUntil my numbers up\nBut for now I gotta run\nThe parties just begun\nI can't get enough\n\nWe only get one time around\nYou better get it while you can\nIf you let this old world go and get you down life will slip right through your hands\nLife will slip right through your hands\nOh I can't get enough\nNo no I can't get enough\nOh I can't... get enough"}
