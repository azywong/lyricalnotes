I was with my ex-girlfriend\nEverytime you called I told you,\n\"baby I'm workin.\" (no!)\nI was out doin my dirt (oh!)\nWasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt\n(I) was hand in hand in the beverly center like man\nNot givin' a damn who sees me\nSo gone (I know)\nSo wrong (just listen)\nThinkin' I got it and left you sittin' at home\nThinkin' about me\nBein' a good girl that you are\nBut you prolly believe you got a good man\nI man that never would do the things \nI'm about to tell you I've done\nBrace yourself\nIt ain't good\nBut it would be even worse \nIf you heard this from somebody else \n\n[refrão]\nEvery thing that I've been doin' is all bad\nI got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride\nI've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad\nAnd I just wanna confess \nCause it's been goin' on so long\nAnd I've been doin' you so wrong \nAnd I want you to know that\nEvery thing that I've been doin' is all bad\nI got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride\nI've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad\nAnd I just wanna confess \nCause it's been goin' on so long\nGirl I've been doin' you so wrong \nAnd I want you to know that\n\n[verse 2]\nIf I could turn back the hands of time \nAnd start all over I would\nInstead of everything bein' all bad \nBaby everything will be all good\nI don't wanna lose you \nBut I know what I'm telling you \nain't gon' make you wanna stay, \nProbally just make you run away \nOr mad enough to punch me in my face\nI've been livin' like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it\nI know, today is the day that I ain't gonna play in a board\nGirl, I'm sorry baby I'm sorry\nBut I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest\nI confess...\n\n[refrão]\nEvery thing that I've been doin' is all bad\nI got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride\nI've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad\nAnd I just wanna confess \nCause it's been goin' on so long\nAnd I've been doin' you so wrong \nAnd I want you to know that\nEvery thing that I've been doin' is all bad\nI got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride\nI've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad\nAnd I just wanna confess \nCause it's been goin' on so long\nGirl I've been doin' you so wrong \nAnd I want you to know that"}
