Don't play hide and seek \n\nLike when you want me and you let me know \nLike when you hold me and you don't let go \nEach time I see you walking through my door \nI feel the passion growing more and more \n\nDon't make me wait around for your reply \n(Don't make me wait around) \nMake up your mind boy, don't you move too slow \nTell me you want my love come on let go \n\n(Chorus 2x) \n\nWhen we touch \nI feel this strong attraction \nYou know I felt it from the start \nAnd when we kiss it starts a chain reaction \nAnd it's burning its way straight to my heart\n\nBreak\n\nDon't make me wait too long for your reply \n(Don't make me wait too long) \nYou ought to know that you don't have to hide \nTell me you're ready boy look in my eyes \n\n(Chorus 4x)"}
