Oh yeah\nShe said, you don't know me\nYou don't wear my chains...oh yeah\nYeah\n\nEssential and appealed...\nCarry all your thoughts... \nAcrossan open field...\nWhen flowers gaze at you...\nThey're not the only ones \nWho cry when they see you\nYou said\n\nYou don't know me\nYou don't even care... Oh yeah\nShe said, you don't know me\nYou don't wear my chains...oh yeah\n\nShe said I think I'll go to Boston\nI think I'll start a new life\nI think I'll start it over, where no one knows my name\nI'll get out of California, I'm tired of the weather\nI think I'll get a lover and fly'em out to Spain\n\nI think I'll go to Boston,\nI think that I'm just tired\nI think I need a new town, to leave this all behind\nI think I need a sunrise, I'm tired of the sunset\nI hear it's nice in the summer some snow would be nice... oh yeah\n\nBoston...where no one knows my name, yeah\nNo one knows my name...\nNo one knows my name...yeah\nBoston... no one knows my name\nBoston... no one knows my name"}
