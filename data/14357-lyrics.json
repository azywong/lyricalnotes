(hoo)\nShe told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me\nThen showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)\n'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nPeople always told me, \"Be careful of what you do\nAnd don't go around breaking young girls' hearts\"\nShe came and stood right by me\nThen the smell of sweet perfume\nThis happened much too soon\nShe called me to her room\n\n[Chorus]\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son\nShe says I am the one, but the kid is not my son\nShe says I am the one, but the kid is not my son\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son\nShe says I am the one, but the kid is not my son\nShe says I am the one\nShe says she is the one\nShe says I am the one\n\n[Outro]\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover"}
