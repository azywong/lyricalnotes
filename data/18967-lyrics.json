I cry\nAs the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die\nVisions of Hell tormented my faith\nSo I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape\n\n[Break: Judge (jury)]\n(Your arm?! No way God dammit)\n(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta\nEsos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)\n[Calm down people, please calm down\nLet us please proceed with the defendants' explanation ]\n\n[Verse 3: Killah Priest]\nEnter the realms of understanding\nAnd take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning\nThree stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells\n*Shh* rain drops hits the pails\nPath is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow\nI'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow\nSo narrow, only one could enter at a time\nStuck in the center, read the signs\nA thousand doors to choose, you better hurry\nDon’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry\nOn your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters\nWatch your step, it's deep waters\nWhat's that coming through the floor? It's a claw\n*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core\n(ahhh!!)\n\n[Verse 4: Frukwan]\nStroll through the dark conditions\nI stone you till I see sparks of friction\nI chop ya like a coal miner\nThen combine the drug and mix it with your blood\nSome more, I give you some moreand watch you crawl\nGuts hit the floor, worms exit your pores\nI trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe\nDeep into my thoughts and bust out your skin\nYou scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand\nYou're up to your hands in quicksand\nYou're sinking and sinking deep into the earth\nThoughts was possessed since the first day of birth\nMy mental says it's my turn to possess the matter\nStab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder\nThoughts become shattered, confused and tragic\nFiery thoughts of Gravediggaz\n\n[Outro: Judge]\nGuilty, next case"}
