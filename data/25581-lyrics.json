(no!), we've had a shit day (no!)\nI think that life's too short for this\nWant back my ignorance and bliss\nI think I've had enough of this, (blow me one last kiss)\n\nI won't miss all of the fighting that we always did,\nTake it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left\nNo more sick whiskey-dick, no more battles for me\nYou'll be calling a trick, cause you'll no longer sleep\nI'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone\nI will laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home\n\nI think I finally had enough\nI think I maybe think too much\nI think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)\nYou think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit\nMy head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)\n\nJust when it can't get worse, I've had a shit day (no!)\nYou`ve had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)\nI think that life's too short for this\nWant back my ignorance and bliss\nI think I've had enough of this, (blow me one last kiss)\n\nBlow me one last kiss\n\nBlow me one last kiss\n\nI will do what I please, anything that I want\nI will breathe, I won't breathe\nI won't worry at all\nYou will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear\nAll the lies, all the wise, will be crystal clear\n\nI think I finally had enough\nI think I maybe think too much\nI think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)\nYou think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit\nMy head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)\n\nJust when it can't get worse, I've had a shit day (no!)\nHave you had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)\nI think that life's too short for this\nWant back my ignorance and bliss\nI think I've had enough of this, (blow me one last kiss)\n\nBlow me one last kiss\n\nBlow me one last kiss\n\nJust when it can't get worse, I've had a shit day (no!)\nHave you had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)\nI think that life's too short for this\nWant back my ignorance and bliss\nI think I've had enough of this, (blow me one last kiss)"}
