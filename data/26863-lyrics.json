Tell me, tell me am I right or am I reading this wrong?\nThey'll play the last song, the lights will come on, that don't mean we can't take the long way home, home, home\n\nCause I'm already thinking bout you and me getting out of here and taking a drive\nJust slide a little closer, put your head on my shoulder like this ain't our first time\nGirl, don't worry bout holdin' on tight cause I'm already calling, I'm already calling you mine\n\nIf you like the way that sounds, we can leave this place right now, right now\n\nCause I'm already thinking bout you and me getting out of here and taking a drive\nJust slide a little closer, put your head on my shoulder like this ain't our first time\nGirl, don't worry bout holding on tight cause I'm already calling, I'm already calling you mine\n\nWhoa, whoa, already calling you min\nWhoa, whoa"}
