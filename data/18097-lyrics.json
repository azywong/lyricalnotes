Yeah!\nThinkin' back on all the arguments\nThinkin' back way back when\nWe kissed and made up and all was fair in love\n\nSo now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)\nGoing back to when (Going back to when you were mine)\nWhen we were one (remembering the times when we were one, one in love)\nWhen love was fun (ohh baby, baby)\nDig it...\n\nRemembering the first time you showed me your love\nThe feeling was so strong heaven sent from above\nBut you had no right to play with my heart\nYou showed no shame\nTime after time and place after place\nNight after night and day after day\nI'm still missing your love and the feelings we share\nSometimes I cry at night coz' I feel so all alone\nI need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm\n\n(maybe we can turn the hands of time)\nI'm going back to when (going back to when, when you were mine)\nWhen we were one...we were one girl\nOhh baby girl....\nWhen we were one....\nBaby save me, I'm thinkin, thinkin' back....\nPlay Mr. Music Man Play\nPlay Mr. Music Man\nUa...ohh..ohh..\nI'm Thinkin' back...."}
