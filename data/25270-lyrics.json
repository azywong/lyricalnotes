{"song_name":"After Midnight","artist_id":298592,"display_artist":"Blink-182","spotify_id":"1oRXq9KvTvZQ0yXvO6OBXE","lyrics":"I can't get my feet up off the edge\nI kinda like the little rush you get\nWhen you're standing close to death\nLike when you're driving me crazy\n\nHold on as we crash into the earth\nA bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real\nCause you were driving me crazy\n\nBy your lips, your words a robbery\nDo you grin inside? You're killing me\nAll along we talked of forever\nI kinda think that we won't get better\nIt's the longest start but the end's not too far away\nDid you know I'm here to stay\n\nWe'll stagger home after midnight\nSleep arm and arm in the stairwell\nWe'll fall apart on the weekend\nThese nights go on and on and on\n\nI can't keep your voice out of my head\nAll I hear are many echoes of\nThe darkest words you said\nAnd it's driving me crazy\n\nI can't find the best in all of this\nBut I'm always looking out for you\nCause you're the one I miss\nAnd it's driving me crazy\n\nBy your lips, your words a robbery\nDo you grin inside? You're killing me\nAll along we talked of forever\nI kinda think that we won't get better\nIt's the longest start but the end's not too far away\nDid you know I'm here to stay\n\nWe'll stagger home after midnight\nSleep arm and arm in the stairwell\nWe'll fall apart on the weekend\nThese nights go on and on and on\n\nWe'll stagger home after midnight\nSleep arm and arm in the stairwell\nWe'll fall apart on the weekend\nThese nights go on and on and on\n\nWe'll stagger home after midnight\nSleep arm and arm in the stairwell\nWe'll fall apart on the weekend\nThese nights go on and on and on"}
