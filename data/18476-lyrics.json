(come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\n\n[Verse 2: Buckshot]\nOne Mississippi, two Mississippi\nSucker tried to diss me so I played him like a hippie\nFrom the 60's, but I'mma get paid from the 90's\nQuick to play you Little Rascals out like Stymie\nKicking flavor, with my Life Saver techniques\nGuaranteed to move feets and I go on for weeks\nMaybe years if my peers give me ears to fill\nLick off a shot and act ill, parlay then chill\nSee I paid my dues, now you can't tell me nothing\nThis is dedicated to the ones who kept fronting\nThe ones who tried to diss and pose high? Oh no\nJust cause you had 'lo, see now I got dough\nAnd I'm paid out my rectum, meaning my backbone\nGrab the mic, flip a mad script to your dome\nSuckers, I kick 'em like tae kwon do\nGuess and 'Lo, from head to toe to let you know\n\n[Chorus: Black Moon]\nWho got the props?

(come on!)\n\n[Verse 3: Buckshot]\nI'm the rugged operator like Arnold Schwarzenegger\nBuckshot quick to play your nigga like Sega\nSmooth trigger-happy snappy, keep my hair nappy\nWhen I swing an ep girls call me \"big pappy\"\nI used to play a game called \"Ring Around the Rosey\"\nBut now I play the mic, that's why the whole world knows me\nI'm sort of like a Chevy, heavy when I bumrush\nYou'd better bring your whole damn crew or get your head crushed\nSucker - cause I'mma set it off with one shot\nOne trigger, one nigga, 'nuff heads drop\nDon't even try to play me out cause static\nBuckshot Shorty, he sounds like an automatic\nRip the set, my friend's mad tight\nCause I rocks the mic and keeps the crowd hype\nStraight from Bumrush, I crush and cause chaos\nYo, and I'mma let you know\n\n[Chorus: Black Moon]\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot!

(come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\n\n[Verse 4: Buckshot]\nOne, two, melody shows\nAnd before I flip a script you know I must keep you dozing\nInto the stage of the Buckshot Shorty\nSon pass the boom, keep the top on the 40\nNever ever ever get played: KILL THAT\nBust a mad cap in your back cause I'm all that\nStraight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn\nE loop the hook and, your whole beat's tooken'\nMust take charge, bomb guard, I'm the man\nBust my plan, it feeds back on my fam\nOnce I cruise, pay dues, I never lose\nWhen I break on fools, wake up, you don't snooze\nBust a move, I get smooth like Roadie\nKick it like the Four Horsemen, yeah you know me\nBooming like a speaker with my 100 dollar sneakers\nBaggy black jeans, knapsack, and my beeper\nKeep a fresh cut, never see me with a busted 'fro\nAnd I'mma let you know...\n\n[Chorus: Black]\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\nWho got the props? (come on!)\n5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot!
