It's pretty early\nIt's ok, we'll take our time\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nAyo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me\nWe ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E\nWe still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?\nIf he sexy, he planking on me\nSo when them big boys want all of that (Ay!)\nTell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)\nIt's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)\nMight let him take it home and slaughter that\nHe got friends for all of my friends\nThey ain't leaving 'till we say when\nAnd we gon' hangover the next day\nBut we will remember this day\nSo drop the pop and get low\nOr we can drop the top and just cruise\nWe fresh to death, down to the shoes\nMy only motto in life is don't lose\n\nI never worry, life is a journey\nI just wanna enjoy the ride\nWhat is the hurry? It's pretty early\nIt's ok, we'll take our time\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nWe're just getting started yeah yeah\nWe're just getting started yeah yeah\nCan't you see the night's still early\nAnd we gon' get wild and crazy\n\nWe're just getting started yeah yeah\nWe're just getting started yeah yeah\nCan't you see the night's still early\nAnd we gon' get wild and crazy\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nThe night is still young\nAnd so are we\n\nHow dare we sit quietly\nAnd watch the world pass us by\nHow dare we sit quietly\nAnd watch the world pass us by"}
