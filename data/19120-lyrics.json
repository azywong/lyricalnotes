(down, down, down)\nDo you want me now?\nDo you want me now? (down, down, down)\nDo you want me now?\nDo you want me now?\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't you think I've heard the talk?\nNobody's gonna tell me who to love\nBeen breaking down\nDo you want me now?\nDo you want me now?\n\n[Chorus]\nSuddenly I'm down on Herald Square\nLooking in the crowd, your face is everywhere\nJust turning 'round\nDo you want me now?\nDo you want me now?\nBeen breaking down\nDo you want me now?\nDo you want me now?\nI'm just breaking down, down, down, down\nBeen breaking down, down, down, down\nBeen breaking down, down, down, down\nBeen breaking down, down, down, down\nBeen breaking down, down, down, down"}
