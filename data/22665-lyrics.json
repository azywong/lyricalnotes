I've given up\nAnd it's too late to turn back now\nCry in shame, you're just drunk\nSo let me sober you up\n\nWatch me walk away\nYou're falling deeper than you've been before\nYou could never be the one for me\nBut now you're nothing at all\n\nSidewalks and streetlights punching the pavement\nThinking of all the things you've done to make things worse\nI can't believe it's true, that you're not giving in\n\nQuiet down, sober up, cry in vain\n\nWatch me walk away\nYou're falling deeper than you've been before\nYou could never be the one for me\nBut now you're nothing at all\n\nAs sober as you are, you've falling down...\n\nSo cry out the tears from your lungs, and fall away from everything\n\nWatch me walk away\nYou're falling deeper than you've been before\nYou could never be the one for me\nBut now you're nothing at all"}
