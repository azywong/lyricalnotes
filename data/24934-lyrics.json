At The Disco","spotify_id":"5rLi8B8qgk6qThwRnKHW2P","lyrics":"She paints her fingers with a close precision\nHe starts to notice empty bottles of gin\nAnd takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for\nA lonely speaker in a conversation\nHer words are swimming through his ears again\nThere's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for\n\nSay what you mean, tell me I'm right\nAnd let the sun rain down on me\nGive me a sign, I wanna believe\n\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nYou're guaranteed to run this town\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nI'd pay to see you frown\n\nHe senses something, call it desperation\nAnother dollar, another day\nAnd if she had the proper words to say, she would tell 'im\nBut she'd have nothing left to sell 'im\n\nSay what you mean, tell me I'm right\nAnd let the sun rain down on me\nGive me a sign, I wanna believe\n\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nYou're guaranteed to run this town\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nI'd pay to see you frown\n\nMona Lisa, wear me out\nI'm pleased to please ya\nMona Lisa, wear me out\n\nSay what you mean, tell me I'm right\nAnd let the sun rain down on me\nGive me a sign, I wanna believe\n\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nYou're guaranteed to run this town\nWhoa ah ah ah oh, Mona Lisa\nI'd pay to see you frown\n\nSay what you mean, tell me I'm right\nAnd let the sun rain down on me\nGive me a sign, I wanna believe\n\nThere's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for..."}
