Is this pretend?\nI'll take a stand until the end\n\nI'll get by\nI'll survive\nWhen the world's crashing down\nWhen I finally hit the ground\nI will turn myself around\nDon't you try to stop me\nI won't cry\n\nI'll get by\nI'll survive\nWhen the world's crashing down\nWhen I finally hit the ground\nI will turn myself around\nDon't you try to stop me\nI won't cry"}
