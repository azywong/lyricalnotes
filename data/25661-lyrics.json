{"song_name":"Lover's Eyes","artist_id":311935,"display_artist":"Mumford & Sons","spotify_id":"null","lyrics":"Love was kind, for a time\nNow just aches and it makes me blind\n\nThis mirror holds my eyes too bright\nI can't see the others in my life\n\nWere we too young? And heads too strong?\nTo bear the weight of these lover's eyes.\n'Cause I feel numb, beneath your tongue\nNeath the curse of these lover's eyes.\n\nBut do not ask the price I pay,\nI must live with my quiet rage,\nTame the ghosts in my head,\nThat run wild and wish me dead.\nShould you shake my ash to the wind\nLord, forget all of my sins\nOh, let me die where I lie\nNeath the curse of my lover's eyes.\n\nThere's no drink nor drug I tried\nTo rid the curse of these lover's eyes\nAnd I feel numb, beneath your tongue\nYour strength just makes me feel less strong\n\nBut do not ask the price I pay,\nI must live with my quiet rage,\nTame the ghosts in my head,\nThat run wild and wish me dead.\nShould you shake my ash to the wind\nLord, forget all of my sins\nOh, let me die where I lie\nNeath the curse of my lover's eyes.\n\nAnd I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow\nTake my hand, help me on my way.\nAnd I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow\nTake my hand, I'll be on my way.\n\nAnd I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow\nTake my hand, help me on my way.\nAnd I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow\nTake my hand, I'll be on my way.\n\nLa la la, La la la, La la la, la la\nLa la la, La la la, La la la, la la"}
