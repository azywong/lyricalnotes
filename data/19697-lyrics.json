I made this up\nI promised you I'd never give up\n\n\nIf it makes you happy\nIt can't be that bad\nIf it makes you happy\nThen why the hell are you so sad\n\nYou get down, real low down\nYou listen to Coltrane, derail your own train\nWell who hasn't been there before?\nI come round, around the hard way\nBring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread\nAnd serve you french toast again\n\nWell, o. k. I still get stoned\nI'm not the kind of girl you'd take home\n\n\nIf it makes you happy\nIt can't be that bad\nIf it makes you happy\nThen why the hell are you so sad\n\nWe've been far, far away from here\nPut on a poncho, played for mosquitos\nAnd everywhere in between\nWell, o. k. we get along\nSo what if right now everything's wrong?\n\n\nIf it makes you happy\nIt can't be that bad\nIf it makes you happy\nThen why the hell are you so sad"}
