Insomnia..\r\n\r\nI can't get no sleep.\r\n\r\nI can't get no sleep.\r\n\r\nI used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry,\r\nGettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness.\r\nNo electricity, Something's all over me, Greasy,\r\nInsomnia, Please release me and let me dream of,\r\nMakin' mad love to my girl on the heath,\r\nTearin' off tights with my teeth.\r\n\r\nBut there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease,\r\nLike a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast.\r\nAt least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..\r\nBut now I keep myself pep.\r\nDeeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight,\r\nFundamental movement..\r\n\r\nSo when it's black, This insomnia takin'-original-tack(?)\r\nKeep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..\r\n\r\nIiiii caaaan't get nooo sleeeeep..\r\n\r\nI can't get no sleep.\r\n\r\nI can't get no sleep.\r\n\r\nI need to sleep, I can't get no sleep..\r\n\r\nI need to sleep, I can't get no sleep..."}
