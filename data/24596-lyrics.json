We die together\nAnd lie, I said never\n‘Cause our love would be forever\n\nThe world is broken\nHalos fail to glisten\nYou try to make a difference\nBut no one wants to listen\n\nHail, the preachers, fake and proud\nTheir doctrines will be cloud\nThen they'll dissipate\nLike snowflakes in an ocean\n\nLove is forever\nAnd we'll die, we'll die together\nAnd lie, I say never\n‘Cause our love could be forever\n\nNow I've got nothing left to lose\nYou take your time to choose\nI can tell you now without a trace of fear\n\nThat my love will be forever\nand we'll die we'll die together\nLie, I will never\n‘Cause our love will be forever."}
