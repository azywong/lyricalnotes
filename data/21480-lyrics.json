Should I tell you how I feel?\nOh, I want you to know.\nBut then again, I don't. It's so complicated.\n\nOh..just when I think I'm under control.\nI think I finally got a grip.\nAnother friend tells me that, \nMy name is always on your lips.\nThey say I'm more than just a friend, \nthey say I must be blind.\nWell, I admit that I've seen you watch me \nfrom the corner of your eye.\nOh, It's so confusing. I wish you'd just confess. \nBut think of what I'd be losing, \nif your answer wasn't yes.\n\nSo complicated I'm so frustrated,\nI wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,\nI wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay.\nShould I say it, should I tell you how I feel.\nOh I want you to know, but then again I don't, It's so complicated.\n\nOh, I hate it. 'Cuz I've waited.\nSo long for someone like you\nOh, what do I do.\nOh should I say it.\nShould I tell you how I feel.\nI want you to know,but then again I don't.\nIt's so complicated..\nIt's so complicated..\nIt's so complicated.\n"}
