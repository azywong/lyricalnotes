(Time..\nAnd it hurt so bad... Chance..)\n\nTryinâ€™ to find the faith before the fall\nGood manâ€™s down, while a bad manâ€™s standin tall\nStrongest one donâ€™t always win them all\nGoing crazy, going crazy\n\nTime and Chance\nChorus (oh chance and time)\nThe way they do my life is going round\nNever straight up, sideways, upside down\nBrothers livinâ€™ six feet underground\nOh got me crazy, Iâ€™m so crazy\nohh...Time and Chance\n\nChorus\nSo bad.. so, so bad\nA poor man lives in happiness\nA millionaire evil as he wanna be\nA good man going hungry....\nâ€˜Cause of Time and Chance\n\nChorus (Donâ€™t it hurt)\nIâ€™m tryin to find the faith before the fall\nA good manâ€™s down, while a bad manâ€™s standing tall\nA strong man don't always, win â€˜em all\nIâ€™m going crazy, crazy, crazy, baby!\n\nDon't it hurt so bad? (Oh it really hurt so bad)\nAnd it hurt so bad, (Tell me can you feel the pain?)\nDonâ€™t it hurt so bad (Time and Chance)\nAnd it hurt so bad (So bad, so, so, bad)\n(It really hurt so bad, no one can stand the pain, Now is all about Time and Chance)\nTime and Chance......Donâ€™t it hurt so bad\nSo bad, so bad\nDonâ€™t hurt so bad\nAnd it hurt so bad......\n"}
