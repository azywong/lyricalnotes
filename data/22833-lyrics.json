Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\n\nGet your hands off the girl,\nCan't you see that she belongs to me?\nAnd I don't appreciate this excess company.\nThough I can't satisfy all the needs she has\nAnd so she starts to wonder...\nCan you blame her?\n\nsinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\n\nTell me there's a logic out there.\nLeading me to better prepare\nFor the day that something really special might come.\nTell me there's some hope for me.\nI don't wanna be lonely\nFor the rest of my days on the earth.\n\n[solo]\n\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.\nSinging...\nOoohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"}
