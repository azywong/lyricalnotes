Diddy but his name is Earl\nCocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride\nPumpin' nothin' but bass\n\nHe says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'\nAnd, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'\nAnd I feel so doggone outta place\n\nWhen he says\n'Holler back when you get back home'\nI say, 'The only holler back that I know is'\n\n(Chorus)\nIn that holler back in the woods\nWhere the country folks got it good\nHomebrewed, homegrown\nWhere the wild seeds 'a get sown\nIt's a blast from the past\nAll the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras\nLet out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta\nIf you wanna go on back to the holler\nHoller back\n\nTake a left off the Interstate\nGo ten miles\nTake a right on Farm Road 99\nAnd just roll 'til the blacktop ends\n\n'Ya see Mary Jo rockin' that front porch swing\nBikini top and them cut-off jeans\nAnd that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins\n\nAh, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine\nBoy, you're guaranteed to have yourself\nOne hell of a time\nIn that holler back in the woods\nWhere the country folks got it good\nHomebrewed, homegrown\nWhere the wild seeds 'a get sown\nIt's a blast from the past\nAll the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras\nLet out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta\nIf you wanna go on back to the holler\nHoller back\n\nIn that holler back in the woods\nWhere the country folks got it so good\nHomebrewed, homegrown\nWhere the wild seeds 'a get sown\nIt's a blast from the past\nAll the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras\nLet out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta\nIf you wanna go on back to the holler\nHoller back\n\n(Homebrewed, homegrown\nWhere the wild seeds a get sown\nIts a blast from the past\nAll the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras\nHomebrewed, homegrown\nWhere the wild seeds a get sown)\nOoh...)"}
