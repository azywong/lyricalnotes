Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin\nThe image and the style that ya used to\nI look funnyâ€”but yo I'm making money, see\nSo yo world I hope you're ready for me\nNow gather round, I'm the new fool in town\nAnd my sound's laid down by the Underground\nI drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf\nSo just let me introduce myself\nMy name is Humpty, pronounced with a \"umpty\"\nYo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee\nAnd all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee\nI'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty\nYou're gonna fall when the stereos pump me\nI like to rhyme, I like my beats funky\nI'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy\nI'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack\nBut sometimes I get ridiculous\nI'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice\nHey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?\nYeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny\nIt never stopped me from getting busy\nI'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom\nI once got busy in a Burger King bathroom\nI'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee\nThey say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me\nI'm still getting in the girls' pants\nAnd I even got my own dance\n\n[Hook]\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\n\n[Verse Two]\nPeople say \"Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'\"\nThat's all right cause I get things cookin'\nYa stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me\nBut ya can't get near me\nI give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B\nAll the girls they adore me\nOh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere\nCause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear\nMy nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed\nBig like a pickle, I'm still getting paid\nI get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge\nBoth how I'm living and my nose is large\nI get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid\nI use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid\nI sang on \"Doowutchalike\", and if ya missed it\nI'm the one who said, \"Just grab 'im in the biscuits\"\nAlso told ya that I like to bite\nWell, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write\nAll ya had to do was give Humpty a chance\nAnd now I'm gonna do my dance\n\n[Hook]\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\n\n[Breakdown]\nOh, yeah, that's the break, y'all\nLet me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here\nOh, yeah!\nNow that I told ya a little bit about myself\nLet me tell ya a little bit about this dance\nIt's real easy to do--check it out\n\n[Verse Three]\nFirst I limp to the side like my leg was broken\nShaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking\nCrazy wack funky\nPeople say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty\nThat's all right cause my body's in motion\nIt's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion\nAnyone can play this game\nThis is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name\nNo two people will do it the same\nYa got it down when ya appear to be in pain\nHumping, funking, jumping\nJig around, shaking ya rump\nAnd when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump\nTell him step off, I'm doing the Hump\n\n[Hook]\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\n\nBlack people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\nWhite people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\nPuerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump\nSamoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\n\nLet's get stoopid!\n\n[Hook]\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump\n\nOh, yeah, come on and break it down\n\n[Outro]\nOnce again, the Underground is in the house\nI'd like to send a shout out to the whole world\nKeep on doing the Humpty Dance\nAnd to the ladies\nPeace, and Humptiness forever\n\n{Music and fade}"}
