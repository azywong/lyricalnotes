Street Bridge\nFollowed me on to it\nI went out halfway across\nWith that homeless shadow tagging along\nSo I dug for some change\nWouldn't need it anyway\nHe took it lookin' just a bit ashamed\nHe said, You know, I haven't always been this way\n\nI've had my moments, days in the sun\nMoments I was second to none\nMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do\nLike that plane ride coming home from the war\nThat summer my son was born\nAnd memories like a coat so warm\nA cold wind can't get through\nLookin' at me now you might not know it\nBut I've had my moments\n\nI stood there tryin' to find my nerve\nWondering if a single soul on Earth\nWould care at all\nMiss me when I'm gone\nThat old man just kept hanging around\nLookin' at me, lookin' down\nI think he recognized\nThat look in my eyes\nStanding with him there I felt ashamed\nI said, You know, I haven't always felt this way\n\nI've had my moments, days in the sun\nMoments I was second to none\nMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do\nLike the day I walked away from the wine\nFor a woman who became my wife\nAnd a love that, when it was right,\nCould always see me through\nLookin' at me now you might not know it\nBut I've had my moments\n\nI know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight\nThat old man tells his story one more time\nHe says\n\nI've had my moments, days in the sun\nMoments I was second to none\nMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do\nLike that cool night on the E. Street Bridge\nWhen a young man almost ended it\nI was right there, wasn't scared a bit\nAnd I helped to pull him through\nLookin' at me now you might not know it\nOh, lookin' at me now you might not know it\nBut I've had my moments"}
