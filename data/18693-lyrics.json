If love ends,\nThen I promise you, I promise you that\nThat I shall never breathe again,\nBreathe again, breathe again,\nThat I shall never breathe again\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking about\nAbout the way things used to be,\nAnd I can't stop thinking about,\nAbout the love that you made to me,\nAnd I can't get you out of my head,\nHow in the world will I begin\nTo let you walk right out my life\nAnd blow my heart away?\nAnd I can't stop caring about\nAbout the apple of my eye\nAnd I can't stop doing without\nWithout the center of my life\nAnd I can't get you out of my head\nAnd I know I can't pretend,\nThat I won't die if you decide\nYou won't see me again\n\n(chorus)\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking about\nAbout the way my life would be,\nNo, I can't stop thinking about,\nHow could you love me then leave?\nAnd I can't get you out of my mind,\nGod knows how hard I've tried,\nAnd if you walk right out my life\nGod knows I'd surely die\nAnd I can't stop doing without\nWithout the wailing of my heart\nNo I can't stop doing without\nFor I would surely fall apart\nAnd I can't get you out of my mind\nAnd I know I can't deny it\nAnd I would die if you decide\nYou won't see me again...\n\n(chorus)"}
