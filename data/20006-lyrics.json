(ohh yeah)\nHow children are drowning in their tears\nHow we need a place where we can go\nA land where every one will have a hero (even me)\n\n(chorus 2x)\nYet in the middle of stormy weather\nWe won't stumble and we won't fall\nI know a place where all this shelter..\n\n(repeat chorus until end)"}
