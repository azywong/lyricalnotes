Everyone was there.\nThey hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and\nSonny and Cher.\n\nShe feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax.\nAnd from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't\nrelax.\nAnd just before she hangs her head to cry,\nI sing to her a lullaby\nI sing:\n\n(chorus)\nEverything's gonna be all right.\nRock-a-bye, rock-a-bye.\nEverything's gonna be all right.\nRock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye.\n\nShe still lives with her mom outside the city\ndown that street about a half a mile.\nAnd all her friends tell her she's so pretty\nbut she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while.\n'Cause even her smile looks like a frown.\nShe's seen her share of devils in this angel town.\n\n(chorus)\n\nI told her I ain't so sure about this place.\nIt's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face.\nSeems like everybody's got a plan.\nIt's kind of like Nashville with a tan.\n\n(chorus)\n"}
