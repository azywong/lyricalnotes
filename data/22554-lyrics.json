I've had enough mystery\nKeep building it up but you're shooting me down\nBut I'm already down, just wait a minute\nJust sit and wait it, just wait a minute, just sit and wait it\nIf I was in your position\nI'd put down all my ammunition\nI'd wondered why'd it taken me so long\nCause Lord knows that I'm not you\nAnd if I was I wouldn't be so cruel\nCause waiting on love ain't so easy to do\nMust I always be waiting, waiting on you?\nMust I always be playing, playing the fool?\nNo, I can't always be waiting, waiting on you\nNo, I can't always be playing, playing your fool, fool"}
