No\"\n\nI got you\nI got everything\nI've got you\nI don't need nothing\nMore than you\nI got everything\nI've got you\n\nThis weight's too much alone\nSome days I can't hold it at all\nYou take it on for me\nWhen tomorrow's too much\nI'll carry it all\nI've got you\n\nAnd when tomorrow's too much\nI'll carry it all\nI got you\n\nI got you\nI got everything\nI've got you\nI don't need nothing\nMore than you\nI got everything\nI've got you"}
