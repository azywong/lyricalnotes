It's eternal love\nWhenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong\nWe'd have our very own, everlasting love\n\nReal love to last forever\nReal love to last forever\n\nYou give me\nYou give me\nYou give me everlasting love\nYou give me\nYou give me\nYou give me everlasting love\nYou give me\nYou give me\nYou give me everlasting love\n\nYou know you give it to me\nEverlasting love\n\n[Chorus]\nOpen up your eyes, then you'll realize\nHere I stand with my, everlasting love\nNeed you by my side, want to be your bride\nYou'll never be denied, everlasting love\nFrom the very start, open up your heart\nBe a lasting part of everlasting love\n\nReal love to last forever\nReal love to last forever\n\n[Chorus]\nOpen up your eyes, then you'll realize\nHere I stand with my, everlasting love\nNeed you by my side, want to be your bride\nYou'll never be denied, everlasting love\nFrom the very start, open up your heart\nBe a lasting part of everlasting love\n\nEverlasting love\nEverlasting love\nEverlasting love\nEverlasting love\n\nYou know you give me\nYou know you give me\nYou know you give it to me\nEverlasting love\n\nYou know you give me\nYou know you give me\nYou know you give it to me\nEverlasting love\nEverlasting love"}
