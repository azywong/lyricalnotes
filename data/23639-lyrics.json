Vincent Williams)\nYou dont have to go now honey\nCall and tell em you wont be in today\nBaby there aint nothin at the office\nSo important it cant wait\nIm thankful for the weekend\nBut two days in heaven just aint gonna do\nThis is gonna take forever darlin\nGirl I just got started lovin you\nWhats the point in fightin what were feelin\nWe both know well never win\nAint this what were missin\nLets just stop all this resistin and give in\nLet me wrap my arms around you\nYou know you dont want to leave this room\nCome back and let me hold you darlin\nGirl I just got started lovin you\nWhat can I say Ive never felt this way\nGirl youre like a dream come true\nAfter all the love weve made\nIt sure would be a shame\nIf we let this moment end so soon\nSo wont you lay back down beside me\nGirl just like I know youre wantin to\nTrust me when I tell you darlin\nGirl I just got started lovin you\nIm thankful for the weekend\nBut two days in heaven just aint gonna do\nThis is gonna take forever darlin\nGirl I just got started lovin you\nCome back and let me hold you darlin\nGirl I just got started lovin you"}
