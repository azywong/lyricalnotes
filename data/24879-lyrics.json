Hear me talk, hear me sing\nOpen up the door, easy less, easy more\nTell me to beware, are you here, are you there?\nIs there something I should know? Easy come, easy go\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nNoddin your head, don't hear a word I say\nI can't communicate, when you wait, don't relate\nI try to talk to you but you never even knew\nSo.what's it gonna be? Tell me can you hear me?\n(hear me? can you hear?)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sick of it, your attention deficit\nNever listen, never listen\nI'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit\nNever listen, never listen\nI scream your name! It always stays the same\nI scream and shout! So what I'm gonna do?\nNow is freak the freak out\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHey! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\n[Verse 2]\nPatience running thin, running thin, come again\nTell me what I get, opposite opposite\nShow me what is real, if it breaks, does it heal?\nOpen up your ear, why d'you think that I'm here?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nKeep me in the dark,are you even thinking of me?\nIs there someone else above me, gotta know gotta know\nWhat am I gonna do, 'cause I can't get through to you\nSo what's it gonna be, tell me can u hear me?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sick of it, your attention deficit\nNever listen, never listen\nI'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit\nNever listen, never listen\nI scream your name!
