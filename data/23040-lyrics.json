You will see\n\n\nThen he said, \n\nHere's a riddle for you\nFind the Answer\nThere's a reason for the world\nYou and I... \n\nPicked up my kid from school today \n\nDid you learn anything cause in the world today\nYou can't live in a castle far away\nNow talk to me, come talk to me\n\n\nHe said, \n\nDad I'm big but we're smaller than small\nIn the scheme of things, well we're nothing at all\nStill every mother's child sings a lonely song\nSo play with me, come play with me \n\nAnd Hey Dad\nHere's a riddle for you\nFind the Answer\nThere's a reason for the world\nYou and I... \n\nI said, \n\nSon for all I've told you\nWhen you get right down to the\nReason for the world...\nWho am I? \n\nThere are secrets that we still have left to find\nThere have been mysteries from the beginning of time\nThere are answers we're not wise enough to see \n\nHe said... You looking for a clue I Love You free... \n\nThe batter swings and the summer flies\nAs I look into my angel's eyes\nA song plays on while the moon is hiding over me\nSomething comes over me \n\nI guess we're big and I guess we're small\nIf you think about it man you know we got it all\nCause we're all we got on this bouncing ball\nAnd I love you free\nI love you freely \n\nHere's a riddle for you\nFind the Answer\nThere's a reason for the world\nYou and I..."}
