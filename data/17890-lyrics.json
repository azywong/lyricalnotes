Boy, can't you see?\nI want you\nI need you\nI'll be yours for the rest of my life\nI just want to hold you\nand I never told you that\nI want this love to last\nso let's not move too fast.\nSlow it down, you're moving too fast for me.\nI want you, baby\nI need you for the rest of my life\nI want this love to last\nso let's not move too fast\nTake your time, won't you take your time"}
