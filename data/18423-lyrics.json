I know we'll get by\nBecause our love's enough to see us through\nWell if we take a chance, we can make it at last\nI know that it's the right thing to do\n\nBut I don't think we're living in sin\nSo we can't give up, we can't give in\nBecause our love is strong, and it can't we wrong\nOh and it feels so right\n\nChorus\n\n'Cause our love is so strong\nAnd nothing's gonna keep us apart\n\nSleeping with you tonight\nWe'll be together tonight\nWell I don't care if it's wrong or right\nI'll be sleeping with you\nI'll be sleeping with you tonight\nWe'll be together tonight\nI don't care if it's wrong or right\nI'll be sleeping with you,\nSleeping with you tonight\nYeah sleeping with you\n"}
