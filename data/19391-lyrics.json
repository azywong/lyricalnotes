Ahh...\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\nSitting at home another lonely night\nWish you were here so I can hold you tight\nPain in my heart because I'm all alone\nWhy did you leave\nWhy did your love have to go\nI would do anything for you\nI would\nThinking of ways I could win your heart\nBut I'm so confused that I don't know where to start\nVisions of love forever in my mind\nI wait for the day that I can say that love is mine\n'Cause I would do anything for you\nYes, I would\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\nSo what can I do to prove that I need your love\nWhat will it take because I won't give up\nOpen your heart and let your feelings show\n'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you go\nGirl, I would do anything for you\nYes, I would\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\nSo if there every comes a time\nWhen it is true love you hope to find\nJust call out my name\nAnd girl, that's when I would do anything\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you"}
