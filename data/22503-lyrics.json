Ohhh Ah oh Ah\n\nRan into an old friend yesterday\nCaught me by surprise when he called my name\nHe was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past\nTalked for awhile, I smiled and then\nSaid that he was seeing somebody and\nTold me this was gonna last\nShowing me her photograph\n\nAnd all the feelings I thought were gone\nCame rushing back to me at once\nTried to smile and hide the way I felt\nBut I was thinking to myself\n\n\n(Truth is) I never got over you\n(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n(Truth is) I never should have let you go\n(Truth is) and it's killing me cause, now I know\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n\n[verse 2]\nWe reminisce on the way things used to be\nShared a couple laughs, and some memories\nTalked about the things that changed\nSome for good and some for bad\nThen he said good-bye and he paid for brunch\nPromised that we'd always keep in touch\nGrabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts\nWalked away and that was that\n\nAnd all the feelings I thought were gone\nCame rushing back to me at once\nTried to smile and hide the way I felt\nBut I was thinking to myself\n\n\n(Truth is) I never got over you\n(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n(Truth is) I never should have let you go\n(Truth is) and it's killing me cuz now I know\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n\n[bridge]\nNow the truth is, it hurts\nBut I know that the fault's mine\nCause I let him go\nTried to get over it, but it's messed up\nHe's not mine (because I know)\n\n[2x]\n(Truth is) I never got over you\n(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n(Truth is) I never should have let you go\n(Truth is) and it's killing me cuz now I know\n(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still I love with you\n\nI just gotta be honest, I guess\nI-I guess, I'm still in love, in love, in love"}
