Talkin' 'bout you're mad\nCould it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?\nThat’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad\nShow is over, you ain’t gotta act\nName hold weight like kilos\nBoy, you actin' so corny like Fritos\nWouldn’t have none of that without me though\nAin’t none of my business, it's tea though\nOutta ammo, gotta reload\nIf life was a game, you're a free throw\nIt's nothing that you don’t already know\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere’s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow I say this? Fact that you still exist\nNo disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is\nTruthfully I’m through with this\nWhy are we still doing this?\nAnswer the phone like, \"Who is this?\"\nTake your head and knock some sense\nJe ne comprends pas\nAin’t no compliments (duh)\nAin’t no being friends (duh)\nAin’t no false pretense (duh)\nAin’t no make amends (duh)\nAin’t no come against (duh)\nThat’s the story, ain’t no happy ends\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere’s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it lack of ice got you so cold?\nHave you ever felt this on your own?\nWhy you tryin' to play like you’re so grown?\nEverything you own, boy, you still owe\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere’s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Outro]\nYou're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door\nInfinity loving me more and more\nYou're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door\nInfinity loving me more and more\n'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream\nI believe infinity is more than just a made up dream"}
