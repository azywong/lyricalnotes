When you\r\nYou just don't know? What's on\r\nThe other side of the door\r\nWhen you're walking I'll, talk about it\r\nEverything I tried to remember to say\r\nJust went out my head\r\nSo I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand\r\n(Cus I know)\r\n\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't you gonna start hating me\r\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\r\nGirl it's not you, it's me\r\nI gotta gotta figure out what I need\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut we know that we gotta go\r\nOur separate ways\r\nAnd I know it's hard but I gotta do it\r\nAnd it's killing me\r\n'Cause there's never a right time\r\nRight time to say goodbye\r\n\r\nGirl I know your heart is breaking\r\nAnd a thousand times I\r\nFound myself asking, \"Why? Why?&quot;\r\nWhy am I taking so long to say this?\r\nBut trust me, girl I never\r\nMeant to crush your world, and I never\r\nThought I would see the day we grew apart, and I wanna know\r\n\r\nHow do you let it go? When you\r\nYou just don't know? What's on\r\nThe other side of the door\r\nWhen you're walking I'll, talk about it\r\nGirl I hope you understand\r\nWhat I'm tryna say\r\nWe just can't go on\r\nPretending that we get along\r\nGirl how you not gonna see it?\r\n\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't you gonna start hating me\r\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\r\nGirl it's not you, it's me\r\nI gotta gotta figure out what I need\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut we know that we gotta go\r\nOur separate ways\r\nAnd I know it's hard but I gotta do it\r\nAnd it's killing me\r\n'Cause there's never a right time\r\nRight time to say goodbye\r\n\r\nListen to your heart\r\nGirl you know\r\nWe should be apart, baby I\r\nI just can't do it\r\nI, I just can't do it\r\nListen to your heart\r\nGirl you know,\r\nWe should be apart, baby I\r\nI just can't do it\r\nAnd sometimes it makes me wanna cry\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [4x]\r\nDo you hear me crying?\r\n(There's never a right, time...)\r\n\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't you gonna start hating me\r\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\r\nGirl it's not you, it's me\r\nI gotta gotta figure out what I need\r\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\r\nBut we know that we gotta go\r\nOur separate ways\r\nAnd I know it's hard but I gotta do it\r\nAnd it's killing me\r\n'Cause there's never a right time\r\nRight time to say..."}
