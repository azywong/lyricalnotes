(I speak)\nI should have listened to that voice inside me\nI must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind\nTo say the kind of things I said last night\n\nMirror, Mirror hanging on the wall\nYou don't have to tell me\nWho's the biggest fool of all\nMirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me\nAnd bring my baby back\nBring my baby back to me\n\nMirror, Mirror lie to me\nShow me what I wanna see (to me)\nMirror, Mirror lie to me\nShow me what I wanna see\n\nWhy did I let you walk away?\nWhen all I had to do was say 'I'm sorry'\nI let my pride get in the way (in the way)\nIn the heat of the moment I was to blame\nI must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind\nNow in the cold light of the day I realize\n\nMirror, Mirror hanging on the wall\nYou don't have to tell me\nWho's the biggest fool of all\nMirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me\nAnd bring my baby back\nBring my baby back to me\n\nIf only wishes could be dreams\nAnd all my dreams could come true\nThere would be two of us standing here in front of you\nIf you could show me that someone that I used to be\nBring back my baby, my baby to me (my baby to me)\n\nMirror, Mirror hanging on the wall, (Oh, oh)\nYou don't have to tell me\nWho's the biggest fool of all\nMirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me\nAnd bring my baby back\nBring my baby back to me. (my baby back)\n\nMirror, Mirror hanging on the wall, (baby, baby)\nYou don't have to tell me\nWho's the biggest fool of all. (I'm the biggest fool of all)\nMirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me. (lie to me)\nAnd bring my baby back,(Bring my baby back)\nBring my baby back (Baby back, baby back) to me\n\nMirror, Mirror lie to me\nShow me what I wanna see\nMirror, Mirror lie to me (2x)"}
