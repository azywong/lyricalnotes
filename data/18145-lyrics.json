Oh...\nI just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself\nCuz you're just wasting your time, oh...\n\nCHORUS\nNo, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)\nNever ever gonna get it (My lovin')\nNo, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)\nNever ever gonna get it\n(repeat)\n\nNow you promise me the moon and stars\nSave your breath, you won't get very far\nGave you many chances to make change\nThe only thing you changed was love to hate\nIt doesn't matter what you do or what you say\nShe doesn't love you, no way\nMaybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect\nSo you won't be hearing her say, \"No way\"\n\nCHORUS\n\nDoesn't matter what you do or what you say\nShe don't love you, no way\nMaybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect\nSo you won't be hearing her say, \"No way\"\n\n[And now it's time for a breakdown...]\n\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it (whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it, never gonna get it\nNever gonna get it, never get it\n\nNo, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')\nNever ever gonna get it (Sweet lovin')\nNo, you're never gonna get it (My lovin')\nNever ever gonna get it (My lovin')\nNo, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')\nNever ever gonna get it (My lovin')\nNo, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')\nNever ever gonna get it (My lovin')...\n"}
