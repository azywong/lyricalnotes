I-d-e-s\nNevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette\nSo pass it across the table, like ping pong\nI'm gone, beatin' my chest, like King Kong\nIt's on, wrap my lips around a 40\nAnd when it comes to getting another stogie\nFools all kick in, like Shinobi\nNo, he ain't my homie to begin with\nIt's too many hands to be poppin' up, let my friend hit it\nUnless you pull out the fat-crispy\nFive-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history\n‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs\nAnd if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dum-da-dum-dumb\nI come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe\nAvoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos\nThat be blowing off the land, like, \"Where the bomb at?\"\nGive me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bong back\nSuck up the dank like a Slurpee; the serious bomb\nWill make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy\nI got more growing pains than Maggie\n‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie\n\n[Hook]\nI got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack\n\n[Verse 2: Numskull]\nI take sacks to the face whenever I can\nDon't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up\n'Til the joint be burning my hand\nNext time I roll it in a hampa\nTo burn slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh\nHoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in\nThen I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)\n‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free\nHell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief\nWhat's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint\nStop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma\nCrack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it\n‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely\nI gotta take a whiz test to my P-O\nI know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro\nAnd every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty\nBut the Tanqueray straight had me\n\n[Hook]\nI got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack\n\n[Verse 3: Numskull]\nHey, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane\nMy yester-night thing got me hung off the night train\nYou fade, I face, so let's head to the East\nHit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish\nI wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget\nStill rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket\nFoggy windows, soggy Indo\nI'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk\n\n[Verse 4: Yukmouth]\nBeen smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down\nUp in the O-A-K, the Town\nHomies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound\nThen ease up, speed up through the E-S-O\nDrink the V-S-O-P with a lemon squeeze up\nAnd everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller\nThat's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja\nHold up, suck up my weed is all you do\nKick in feed, ‘cause where I be we need half, like Umfufu\n\n[Hook]\nI got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack"}
