It would've been, could've been \nworse than it had even gone\nWell, the car was on blocks, \nbut I was already where I want.\n(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)\n\nWhy should we ever even \never really even get to know?\n(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)\nOh if the world don't like us it'll shake us \njust like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old.\nNow here we go!\n\nWell we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it\nwe've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it\nStanding at a light switch to each east and west horizon,\nEvery dawn you're surprising,\nAnd the evening was consoling\nSaying \"See it wasn't quite as bad as\"\n\nWell, it would've been, could've been \nworse than you would ever know.\nI was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes\nafter you had proved my point wrong,\nIt wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh.\nI just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show.\n\nYeah, it would've been, could've been \nworse than you would ever know.\nOh, the dashboard melted, \nbut we still have the radio.\n(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)\n\nHard-wired to concieve, \nso much we'd have to stow it\nEven needs have needs, \ntiny giants made of tinier giants.\nDon't wear eyelids so \nI don't miss the last laugh of this show.\n(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)\n\nOh, we could've been, should've been \nworse than you would ever know.\n(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)\nWell, you told me about nowhere well \nit sounds like someplace I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh.\nNow here we go!\n\nWell we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it\nwe've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it\nStanding at a light switch to each east and west horizon,\nEvery dawn you're surprising,\nAnd the evening was consoling\nSaying \"See it wasn't quite as bad as\"\n\nOh it would've been, could've been \nworse than you would ever know."}
