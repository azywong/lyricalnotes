Oh, why?\nWhy'd you have to lie to me?\nWhy'd you have to lie to me?\nWhy'd you have to lie to me?\nWhy?\n\nAfter all of the times that we've tried\nI found out we were living a lie\nAnd after all of this love that we made\nI know now you don't love me the same\n\nThe way that I love \nThe way that I love you\nThe way that I love \nThe way that I love you\nThe way that I love \nThe way that I loved you"}
