Real name, no gimmicks – (*record scratch*)\n\n[Refrain 1: Eminem]\nTwo trailer park girls go 'round the outside\n'Round the outside, 'round the outside\nTwo trailer park girls go 'round the outside\n'Round the outside, 'round the outside\n\n[Refrain 2: Eminem]\nGuess who's back, back again\nShady's back, tell a friend\nGuess who's back, guess who's back\nGuess who's back, guess who's back\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to\nSee Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver\nWell, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya\nA little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor\nSome vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker\nThan a shock when I get shocked at the hospital\nBy the doctor when I'm not co-operating\nWhen I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)\nYou waited this long, now stop debating\n‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating\nI know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney\nBut your husband's heart problem's complicating\nSo the FCC won't let me be\nOr let me be me, so let me see\nThey try to shut me down on MTV\nBut it feels so empty without me\nSo, come on and dip, bum on your lips\nFuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits\nAnd get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy\nI just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nLittle hellions, kids feeling rebellious\nEmbarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis\nThey start feeling like prisoners helpless\n'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, \"Bitch!!!\"\nA visionary, vision is scary\nCould start a revolution, polluting the airwaves\nA rebel, so just let me revel and bask\nIn the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​\nAnd it's a disaster, such a catastrophe\nFor you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?\nWell, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\nFix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna\nEnter in, and up under your skin like a splinter\nThe center of attention, back for the winter\nI'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling\nInfesting in your kid's ears and nesting\nTesting, attention please\nFeel the tension soon as someone mentions me\nHere's my ten cents, my two cents is free\nA nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nA tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with\nAnybody who's talking \"this shit, that shit\"\nChris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked\nWorse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards\nAnd Moby? You can get stomped by Obie\nYou 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!\nYou don't know me, you're too old, let go\nIt's over, nobody listens to techno\nNow let's go, just give me the signal\nI'll be there with a whole list full of new insults\nI been dope, suspenseful with a pencil\nEver since Prince turned himself into a symbol\nBut sometimes the shit just seems\nEverybody only wants to discuss me\nSo this must mean I'm disgusting\nBut it's just me, I'm just obscene\nNo, I'm not the first king of controversy\nI am the worst thing since Elvis Presley\nTo do black music so selfishly\nAnd use it to get myself wealthy\n(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works\nTwenty million other white rappers emerge\nBut no matter how many fish in the sea\nIt'll be so empty without me\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me!\n‘Cause we need a little controversy\n‘Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Outro]\nHum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la\nHum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la\nKids!"}
