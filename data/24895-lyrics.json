What do you want? What do you want from me? \nAre you tryin’ to bring back the tears or just the memories?\nYou keep takin’ me back, takin’ me back where I’ve already been. \nWhen we hang up it’s almost like I’m losing you again.\nCan’t you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?\n\nI get so tired of living like this.\nI don’t have the time, neither do my friends, \nTo stay up at night, to pull me through,\nAnd to find the things to keep my mind off of you.\n\nSo, now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?\nDid you call to say you’ve find someone and I’m a used- to- be.\nYou keep takin’ me back, takin’ me back where I’ve already been. \nIf you’ve moved on why does it feel like I’m losing you again?\nCan’t you see? So what do you want? What do you want from me?\n\nWhat do you want me to say?\nThat I’m content? That I’m on the fence? That I wish you would’ve stayed?\n\nOh baby what do you want, what do you want, what do you want from me?\nTo come here and make love tonight cause you’re feelin’ lonely.\nYou keep takin’ me back, takin’ me back where I’ve already been.\nWhen we wake up and say goodbye it’s like I’m losing you again. \nCan’t you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?\nWhat do you want, what do you want from me?"}
