Woods) \nBaby, this situation's driving me crazy \nAnd I really wanna be your lady \nBut the one before you left me so \n\nChorus I \nDamaged, Damaged \nI thought that I should let you know \nThat my heart is Damaged \nSo Damaged \nAnd you can blame the one before \n\nChorus II \nSo how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it \nHow you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it \nBaby I gotta know \nWhat are you gonna do \n\n(Aundrea) \nDo--do you got a first aid kit handy \nDo--do you know how to patch up a wound tell me \nAre you--Are you patient, understanding? \nCause I might need some time to clear the hold on my heart and I \n\n(Aubrey) \nYou try to gain my trust \nTalking is not enough \nActions speak louder than words \nYou gotta show me something \nMy heart is missing some pieces \nI need this puzzle put together again \n\nRepeat Chorus I \nRepeat Chorus II \n\n(D.
