(Do you copy?)\nWhere's your brain? (Do you copy?)\nChecking in to check you out\nConcerned about your whereabouts\nCoffee bag, you're acting strange\nSo tell me what is going on\nSo heavy I bet\n\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nI'm feeling positive for real, I'm all good no\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nIt's gotten complicated that's for sure\n\nBut you can see it in my eyes, you can read on my lips\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\nAnd I really mean it this time\nAnd you know it's such a trip\nDon't get me started\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nGet in line, and settle down\n\nNo big deal (I can handle it)\nIt'll bounce off me (I can handle it)\nIn or out, moved block before, doesn't matter anymore\nHere we go again, are you insane?\nWe're underneath the avalanche so heavy again\n\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nI'm feeling positive for real, I'm all good no\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nIt's gotten complicated that's for sure\n\nBut you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\nAnd I really mean it this time\nAnd you know it's such a trip\nDon't get me started\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nGet in line, and settle down\n\nI'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough\nAnd nothing's gonna knock this girl down\nI'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough\nAnd nothing's gonna knock this girl down\nI'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough\nAnd nothing's gonna knock this girl down\nI'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough\n\nBut you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\nAnd I really mean it this time\nAnd you know it's such a trip\nDon't get me started\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\n\nGotta get a hold on this\nTrying to get a hold on this\nDon't get me started\nGotta get a hold on this\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nGet in line, and settle down\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nGet in line, and settle down\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nGet in line, and settle down\n\nGet get get in line, and settle down\nIn line and settle down"}
