Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk\nIts up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know\nCause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho\nIf ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room\nWe can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon\nGive me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya\nJust be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya\nSome women like to play it foul\nBut them the kind I put in a place like a child don't worry be happy and smile\n\n[Hook: J-Weav, Chingy]\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away\n\n[Outro: J-Weav]\nDTP, ha, how we do, ha, give me call, if you wanna ball, you know what it is"}
