Will you forgive me?\nWill you forgive me? Will you forgive me?\nAsked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down\nTwo times in a day around, will you forgive me?\n\nI can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling\nI can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling\nI can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling\nI can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling\n\nYou're my soul, soul\nYou're my soul, soul"}
