Can I have a pair of wings?\n\"An' do you think that God could use another Angel\n\"To help pour out the rain?\"\nWell, I won't lie: I pulled that car right over\nAn' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes\nAn' I whispered: \"Lord, I want to thank you for my children\n\"'Cause your innocence that fills them often takes me by surprise.\"\nLike: \"Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?\n\"Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay?\n\"Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?\n\"An' do you think that God could use another Angel\n\"To help pour out the rain?\"\nWell, I thought about it later on\nAn' a smile came to my face\nAn' when I tucked her in to bed\nI got down on my knees an' prayed\nLord, when I get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?\n\"I don't want to come to visit 'cause I'm comin' home to stay?\n\"An' I can't wait to see my family and meet Jesus face to face\n\"An' do you think, Lord, you could use just one more Angel\n\"To help pour out the rain?\"\nMmmm, can I help pour out the rain?"}
