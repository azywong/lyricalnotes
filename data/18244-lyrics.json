Jump! Jump! Jump! (everybody jump)\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump!\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (everybody jump)\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump!\nJump!\n\n[Verse 2: Everlast]\nI'll serve your ass like John McEnroe\nIf your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe\nWord to your moms, I came to drop bombs\nI got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms\nAnd just like the Prodigal Son I've returned\nAnyone stepping to me, you'll get burned\n'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none\nIf you come to battle, bring a shotgun!\nBut if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death\nTrying to step to me, you'll take your last breath\nI got the skills, come get your fill\n'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill\nI came to get down, I came to get down\nSo get out your seat and jump around!\n\n[Hook]\nJump around!\nJump around!\nJump around!\nJump up, jump up and get down!\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (everybody jump)\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump!\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (everybody jump)\nJump! Jump! Jump! Jump!\nJump!\n\n[Verse 3: Everlast]\nI'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top\nI never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop\nOr better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzanegger\nTry to play me out like as if my name was Sega\nBut I ain't going out like no punk bitch\nGet used to one style and yo and I might switch\nIt up, up and around, then buck, buck you down\nPut out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead\nI'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya\nSpitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya\nI came to get down, I came to get down\nSo get out your seat and jump around!\n\n[Hook]\nJump around!\nJump around!\nJump around!\nJump up, jump up and get down!\nJump!
