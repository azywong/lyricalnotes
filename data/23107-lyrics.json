Was I wrong?\nWere you weak? Was I strong?\nYeah, both of us broken\nCaught in a moment\nWe lived and we loved\nAnd we hurt, and we jumped, yeah\nBut the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes\nAnd just like that, the chemicals react\nThe chemicals react\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou make me feel out of my element\nLike I'm drifting out to the sea\nLike the tide's pulling me in deeper\nMakin' it harder to breathe\n\nWe cannot deny how we feel inside\nWe cannot deny\n\n[Chorus]\nWere you right? Was I wrong?\nWere you weak? Was I strong?\nYeah, both of us broken\nCaught in a moment\nWe lived and we loved\nAnd we hurt, and we jumped, yeah\nBut the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes\nAnd just like that, the chemicals react\nThe chemicals react\n\n[Bridge]\nKaleidoscope of colors\nTurnin' hopes on fire\nSun is burnin', shinin' down on both of us\nDon't let us lose it\nDon't let us lose it\n\n[Chorus]\nWere you right? Was I wrong?\nWere you weak? Was I strong?\nYeah, both of us broken\nCaught in a moment\nWe lived and we loved\nAnd we hurt, and we jumped, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n\nWe lived we loved\nWe hurt we jumped\nWe're right we're wrong\nWe're weak we're strong\nWe lived to learn\n\nBut the planets all aligned\nWhen you looked in to my eyes\nAnd just like that, watch the chemicals react\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd just like that, the chemicals react\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nThe chemicals react"}
