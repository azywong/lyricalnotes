Just like a prayer\nI'll take you there. It's like a dream to me\nJust like a prayer, I'll take you there\nIt's like a dream to me. Just like a prayer\nI'll take you there. It's like a dream to me\n\nLife is a mystery, everyone must stand alone\nI hear you call my name\nAnd it feels like home\n\nJust like a prayer, your voice can take me there\nJust like a muse to me, you are a mystery\nJust like a dream, you are not what you seem\nJust like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there\n\nJust like a prayer, your voice can take me there\nJust like a dream, you are not what you seem\nJust like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there"}
