Feel good\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you\nBaby don't tease. Ooh, just please\n'cause you know it's just me and you\nAll or nothing, push, it's got to be\nSomething's gotta show when you're livin' under heat\nAll or nothing, push, girl, let it be\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat\nI'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow\nGive me some time and maybe, our love will grow\nI want to suit you baby and make it right\nTake it from me babe, I wanna rock all night\nIf it's good for me, it's good for you\nYou gotta never let your mood get dry\nJust keep it wet and my seven forty jet\nIs pushing right on high\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you\nBaby don't tease. Ooh, just please\n'cause you know it's just me and you\nAll or nothing, push, it's got to be\nSomething's gotta show when you're livin' under heat\nAll or nothing, push, girl, let it be\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat\nI'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow\nGive me some time and maybe, our love will grow\nI want to suit you baby and make it right\nTake it from me babe, I wanna rock all night\nPush it up, push it down\nPush it where it feels real good\nOn my lips my sweet bumble bee\nSting me like I knew you could\nAll or nothing, push, it's got to be\nSomething's gotta show when you're lyin' under me\nOh, oh, nothin' girl, let it be\nTake it from the pro, who's rockin' to the beat"}
