Let me know\nCuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so\nGot no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came\nCuz I may be the kind of guy you like\n\nPlease understand the way I feel\nI must have trust or there's no deal\nMy emotion's ain't to be\nPlayed with or given free\nI appreciate greatly\nThe way you toleratered me\nSometimes I do act flaky\nI wouldn't blame you if you hate me\nYou put up with my butt\nWhen I wouldn't give it up\nYeah, I know that really sucks\nBut if you wait awhile, I'll make it up\n\nCHORUS\n\nWho me?  A tease?  Brother, please\nYou're just having bad memories\nAbout some skeeze who did the squeeze\nAnd had you on your hands and knees\nLook, I am telling you straight out\nThat's not what I'm all about\nI'd just be playing myself out\nIf I spent the night at your house\nNow don't get me wrong\nI didn't mean to turn you on\nWe haven't known each other long\nBut this is my life not just a song\n\n"}
