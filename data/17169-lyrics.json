Love Shack yeah\nI'm headin' down the Atlanta highway, lookin' for the love getaway\nHeading for the love getaway, love getaway,\nI got me a car, it's as big as a whale and we're headin' on down\nTo the Love Shack\nI got me a Chrysler, it seats about 20\nSo hurry up and bring your jukebox money\n\nWell the Love Shack is a little place where we can get together\nLove Shack baby, Love Shack bay-bee.\nLove Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!\n\nSign says.. Woo... stay away fools, 'cause love rules at the Love Shack!\nWell it's set way back in the middle of a field,\nJust a funky old shack and I gotta get back\n\nGlitter on the mattress\nGlitter on the highway\nGlitter on the front porch\nGlitter on the hallway\n\nWell the Love Shack is a little place where we can get together\nLove Shack baby! Love Shack baby!\nLove Shack, that's where it's at! Love Shack, that's where it's at!\n\nHuggin' and a kissin', dancin' and a lovin', wearin' next to nothing\nCause it's hot as an oven\nThe whole shack shimmies,\nwhen everybody's movin' around and around and around!\nEverybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby!\nFolks linin' up outside just to get down\nEverybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby\nFunky little shack! Funky little shack!\n\nHop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale and it's about to set sail!\nI got me a car, it seats about 20\nSo come on and bring your jukebox money.\n\nWell the Love Shack is a little place where we can get together\nLove Shack baby, Love Shack bay-bee.\nLove Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!\n\nBang bang bang on the door baby! Knock a little louder sugar!\nBang bang bang on the door baby! I can't hear you!\nBang bang! On the door baby\nBang bang! On the door\nBang bang! On the door baby\nBang bang!\nYou're what?... Tin roof, rusted!\nLove Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!\nLove Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!\nA lot of love at the love shack\n"}
