I wear 10's\nLet's see if you can fit your feet—\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you\n\n[Bridge]\nLately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world\nWhere they can be alone\nAre you calling me?\nAre you trying to get through?\nAre you reaching out for me\nThen I'm reaching out for you\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, to my babies: stay strong\nDaddy'll be home soon\nAnd to the rest of the world\nGod gave you them shoes to fit you\nSo put 'em on and wear 'em\nBe yourself, man, be proud of who you are\nEven if it sounds corny\nNever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful"}
