Now here we go!)\nDJ don't you play nothing slow\nGotta make 'em wanna (what?)\n...gotta make 'em wanna (what?)\n...gotta make 'em wanna come back for more\n\nHey now here we go\nDJ don't you play nothing slow\nKeep those girls out on the floor\nGotta make 'em wanna come back for more\nBeen here since the sun went down\nBe here when it comes back around\nWorked all week it's time to play\nGonna get a little bit sideways (na na na na na)...\nSideways... sideways... sideways\n\nHey girl what's your name?\nit's so loud in here i can't hear a thing....\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nKeep your boots on the road, man!\nolivatto@live.com\n--------------------------------------------------------"}
