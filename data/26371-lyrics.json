Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nSo you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nSo you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nIf I'm a pagan of the good times\nMy lover's the sunlight\nTo keep the Goddess on my side\nShe demands a sacrifice\n\nTo drain the whole sea get something shiny\nSomething meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine looking high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\n\nWe've a lot of starving faithful\nThat looks tasty\nThat looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nso you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nSo you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nNo masters or kings when the ritual begins\nThere is no sweeter innocence\nThan our gentle sin\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then I am human, only then I am clean\n\nAmen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog\nAt the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nSo you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins\nSo you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life"}
