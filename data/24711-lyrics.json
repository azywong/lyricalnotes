(We'll be just fine)\nWould you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)\n\nShe's got a love like woe\nWoah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,\nGirls got a love like woe (la-da-da)\nI kinda feel like it don't make sense\nBecause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again\nLoved so strong, then you moved on\nNow I'm hung up in suspense,\nBecause you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again\n\nShe's got a love like woe\nWoah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,\nGirls got a love like woe (la-da-da)\nI kinda feel like it don't make sense\nBecause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again\nLoved so strong, then you moved on\nNow I'm hung up in suspense,\nBecause you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again"}
