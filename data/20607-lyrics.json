Everybody needs dreams\nAll the joy and happiness\nThat the good life brings\nEverybody needs freedom\nEverybody needs touch\nSomewhere to lay their heads\nWhen it gets to be too much\n\nGot enough time to last forever\nGot enough faith to get us home\nWe're never gonna die and go to heaven\nAll alone\n\n'Cause I believe\nSomebody's out there watchin'\nSomebody's out there watchin'\nI believe\nSomebody's out there watchin'\nSomebody's out there watchin'\nOver me\n\nHidden from us\nIn the sky above us\nI can feel it all around\nHard to see it\nBut I do believe that\nThere are angels looking down\n\nYeah, I believe...\nSomebody's out there watchin'..."}
