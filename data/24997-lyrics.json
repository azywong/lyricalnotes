Oh, where you at ? Oh, where you at ?\nBoy you say would be here for me\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\n\nNow you said you go to church\nStop slanging, find a real job, and go to work\nAnd you say you stay out of the streets\nAnd spend more time with me\nTake away my doubts and fears and fulfill my dreams\nYou said you'd be that shoulder for my eyes to cry on\nSaid you would be that one that I could depend on\nAnd I stood there in the freezing cold\nAnd I waited for you, but you never showed boy\n\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ?\nBoy you say would be here for me\nWhere you at ? (Where)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\n\nAnd oh false promises is much like fake named\nYou painted a picture for me but there was no frame\nYou made my future look bright and I believed every word\nI went to sleep on the clouds and woke up in the dirt\nAnd now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing\nYou say you'd be there for me boy when the tough got going\nSaid if weapons draw, you'd stand in front of me\nWhenever I fell trapped, said you'd be the one to set me free\nThought you were my hero\nBut as it turns out you a no show\nTell me where\n\nWhere you at ? ( you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Where you at babe ?)\nWhere you at ?\nOh you said would be there for me\nWhere you at ? (Where you at ?)\nWhere you at ? (Baby where you at ?)\nWhere you at ?\nYou said you'd be right there for me\nWhere you at ? (And I can't)\nWhere you at ? (See)\nWhere you at ? (See, See)\nWhere you at ? (See)\nWhere you at ?\nYou'd said you'd be right there for me\nSo i'm waiting on ya right here\nUntil you appear\nAnd deliver, deliver, deliver\nDeliver boy\nDeliver, deliver, deliver"}
