Blige","spotify_id":"5hXIG7ldYtrTPV7Unonr8N","lyrics":"The problem is\nFor many years\nI've lived my life\nPublicly\nSo it's hard for me to find a man I trust\nI really trust\nAnd everytime I find someone I like\nGotta worry about\nIf it's really me\nThat they see\nAnd I thought you were the one, ohhhh\n\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\n\nI don't have a lot of friends\nAnd sometimes I have to wonder\nIs it cash they see when they look at me\n'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free\nSo I made the choice to be\nGood to those who are good to me\nDon't judge me, don't think I'm bitter\nFor the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary\n\nI'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary\nI'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary\nI, I, ohhhh\n\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\n\nThe car i drive, the clothes i wear\nThe diamonds, the flowers, and the house\nDon't make a woman\nMaterial things don't mean nothin' to me\nSo, i need someone to stand by me and\nSupply my needs\nAnd i'm just plain ol' mary\nWhy can't you love the person inside\nAnd stop lookin' outside\n\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\nDeep inside I wish that they could see\nThat I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary\n\nThe problem is\nFor many years\nI've lived my life\nPublicly\nAnd everytime I find a man\nI, I can't trust him\nOhhhh"}
