Away from everybody\nBreak! Away from everything\nIf you can't stand the way this place is\nTake! Yourself! To higher places!\n\nAt night I feel like a vampire\nIt's not right but I just can't give it up\nI'll try to get myself higher\nLet's go! We're gonna light it up\n\nTonight we start the fire\nTonight we break away\n\nBreak! Away from everybody\nBreak! Away from everything\nIf you can't stand the way this place is\nTake! Yourself! To higher places!\n\nIf you can't stand the way this place is\nTake! Yourself! To higher places!\nBreak! Away from everybody\nBreak! Away from everything\nIf you can't stand the way this place is\nTake! Yourself! To higher places!\nHigher places!\nTo higher places!\nHigher places!\nTake yourself to higher places!"}
