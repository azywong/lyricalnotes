There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my\nOops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my\nOoh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my\nOoh! I'm turnin' red who could this be\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried and I tried to avoid\nBut this thing was happening\nSwallow my pride, let it ride\nAnd parted, but this body felt just like mine\nI got worried\nI looked over to the left\nA reflection of myself\nThat's why I couldn't catch my breath\n\n[Chorus]\nOops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my\nOops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my\nOoh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my\nOoh! I'm turnin' red who could this be\n\n[Bridge]\nI looked over to my left\nMmm, I was lookin' so good I couldn't reject myself\nI looked over to my left\nMmm, I was feelin' so good I had to touch myself\nI looked over to the left\nMmm, I was eyein' my thighs, butter pecan brown\nI looked over to the left\nMmm, coming out of my shirt and then my skirt came down\n\n[Chorus]\nOops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my\nOops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my\nOoh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my\nOoh! I'm turnin' red who could this be\n\n[Outro]\nOops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my\nOops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my\nOoh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my\nOoh! I'm turnin' red who could this be"}
