Puttin' your business on wax\nWhen we could scrap or slap a clip, if you wanted to crack\nSee in the pen we got a name for niggas runnin' they yap\nSale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back\nHandles ours, battle scars, Shackles, guards and all\nAnd we the last niggas standin' once they start to fall\nMake the call, or fuck it, just kick off the brawl\nCuz I'm ridin' with my doggs, win, lose, or draw\nDogg pound insane, neighborhood twenty gangin' it\nAnd every gangsta that I hang with down to bang\nFull time pull mines and I gots to bust\nFuck a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched\nSo make my name taste just like a dick in your mouth\nAnd watch the way you on my nuts when you spittin' it out\nDogghouse\n\nRepeat Bridge\n\nChorus 1/4X\n\n[Sylk E. Fine]\nYou got a muthafuckin' problem with my niggas then you got one with me\nIt's the S to the Y, the L, just drop three keys\nAs I flee, to the homie L.T.'s, to make the magic\nIt's those that talk, and those that make shit happen\nSo what'cha say?  You wanna spit? You got beef?\nD.P serve the heat, straight to the street\nHoney west, I make the mission complete\nTherefore them bitches who talk that shit\nBe them bitches that's gettin' they ass beat\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nNow don't come round here fuckin' with us\nCuz on the real homeboy, we'll be fuckin' you up\nAnd to you bitches who be thinking y'all could slide by\nWith that punk shit, BITCH, biddity bye bye\nI fuck a bitch up faster than I do a nigga\nSee to me, most bitches is women but bitch you'z a nigga\nWe got rules and codes, G's and hoes\nFriends and foes, ride or get rode on\n\nChorus 1/4x)\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nNigga, nigga, bitch"}
