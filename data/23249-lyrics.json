(say alright)\nWill you say ok? (Say ok)\nWill you stick with me through whatever?\nOr run away\n(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be ok)\nSay Ok.\n\nWhen you call I don't know \nIf I should pick up the phone every time\nI'm not like all my friends \nwho keep calling up the boys, \nI'm so shy\nBut I don't wanna be into you\nIf you don't treat me the right way\nSee I can only start seeing you\nIf you can make my heart feel safe \n(feel safe)\n\nWhen it's not alright\nWhen it's not ok\nWill you try to make me feel better?\nWill you say alright? (say alright)\nWill you say ok? (Say ok)\nWill you stick with me through whatever?\nOr run away\n(Say that it's gonna be alright. \nThat it's gonna be ok\nDon't run away, don't run away)\nSay ok\n\nLet me know if it's gonna be you\nBoy, you've got some things to prove\nLet me know that you'll keep me safe\nI don't want you to run away so\nLet me know that you'll call on time\nLet me know that you won't be shy\nWill you wipe my tears away\nWill you hold me closer\n\nWhen it's not alright\nWhen it's not ok\nWill you try to make me feel better\nWill you say alright? (say alright)\nWill you say ok? (Say ok)\nWill you stick with me through whatever?\nOr run away\n(Say that it's gonna be alright. \nThat it's gonna be ok)\n\nSay OK\n(Don't run away, don't run away)\n(Say that it's gonna be alright. \nThat it's gonna be ok, don't run away)\nWill you say OK\n(Say that it's gonna be alright. \nThat it's gonna be ok)"}
