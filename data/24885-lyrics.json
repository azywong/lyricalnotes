(No cabs to be had out there)\nI wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)\nTo break the spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks well)\n\nI ought to say no, no, no, sir (Mind if I move in closer?)\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurting my pride?)\nI really can't stay (Baby, don't hold out)\n\nBlaine (Kurt):\nBaby (Oh, but)\n\nBlaine with Kurt:\nIt's cold outside\n\nKurt (Blaine):\nI simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nThe answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nThis welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)\nSo nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)\n\nMy sister will be suspicious (Gosh, your lips look delicious)\nMy brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Ooh, your lips are delicious)\nBut maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)\n\nI've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)\nSay, lend me your coat (It's up to your knees out there)\nYou've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)\nBut don't you see (How can you do this thing to me?)\n\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think about a lifelong sorrow)\nAt least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)\nI really can't stay (Get over that hold out)\n\nBlaine (Kurt):\nOoh, baby (Oh, but)\n\nKurt with Blaine:\nIt's cold outside"}
