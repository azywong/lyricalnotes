Sexxx]\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day\nOn my way back from John Jay\nI'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train\nI tap her on her shoulders, \"excuse me miss, but can I get your name?\"\nShe said, my name is Renee\nI said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?\nShe said if you want, so yo, we started talking\nI bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking\nI had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat\nSo we must chat about this and that\nShe told me what she was in school for\nShe wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law\nI'm telling shorty I'm a writer\nAnd as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider\nCovers her mouth with her name ring\nI said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing\nBut yet I use Philly blunts\nShe said, \"I never dealt with Philly blunts because I heard that's for silly stunts\"\nI said nah they burn slower\nRight now I really don't know ya\nBut maybe later on, I can get to show you\n\n[Hook]\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo now we sitting on the train\nBesides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain\nNow understand she got flava\nA tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her\nGot off the train about 6:34\nShe wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store\nWent to the crib and turned the lights on\nA mad magazine stand\nFrom Essence to Right On\nA leather couch, stereo system with crazy cd's\nUnderstand, kid, she got G's\nShe said Cheeks, do what you want\nShe said I'm gonna feed the dog\nI said, alright well I'mma roll this blunt\nShe came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt\nA yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl\nWe're sitting on the couch chatting\nWe're smoking blunts off the balcony\nWe're staring at Manhattan\nShe started feeling on my chest\nI started feeling on the breasts\nAnd there's no need for me to stress the rest\nA yo, I got myself a winner\nWe sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner\nShe had a tattoo she only wanted yo to see\nBut first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci\nI'm like whatever shorty rock, we can swing it like that\nCause on the real this is where it's at\n\n[Hook]\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\n\n[Verse 3]\nI woke up the next day on the waterbed\nA letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said\nIt said, \"Cheeks, I'll be home around two\nYou was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you\"\nI left my number for shorty to call me later\nGot dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator\nI got a beep around three\nI'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me\nAnd now we been together for weeks\nCandlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks\nHey man, I never been in love\nBut every time I'm burstin' in and outta state\nIt's shorty that I'm thinking of\nI'm hanging out with my crew\nI get a beep from Renee\nBecause Renee uses Code Two\nBut yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes\nShe says \"Renee has been shot, So Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's\"\nI jumps on the Van Wyck\nI gotta make it there quick\nA yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick\nNot even thinking about the po-nine\nI'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck\nI'm smokin' boom and the whole nine\nI gotta see what's going on\nBut by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me \"Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone\"\nI'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here\nI'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears\n\n[Hook]\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty\nA ghetto love is the law that we live by\nDay by day I wonder why my shorty had to die\nI reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday\nGive it up for my shorty"}
