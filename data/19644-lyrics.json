It feels so big it almost hurts!\n\nNever guessed it got this good\nwondered if it ever would\nreally didn't think it could\ndo it some more?\nI know we should!!!\n\nSay it will always be like this\nthe two of us together\nit will always be like this\nforever and ever and ever...\n\nNever guessed it got this good\nwondered if it ever would\nreally didn't think it could\ndo it all the time?\nI know that we should!!!"}
