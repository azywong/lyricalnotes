Is that you? Is that you?\nAre you a guard in a prison maximum security?\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\nDo we stay home all the time\n'Cause you want me to yourself?\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\nOr am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\n\nWell, I don't like (o-hoo)\nLiving under your spotlight (o-hoo)\nJust because you think I might (o-hoo)\nFind somebody worthy\nOh, I don't like (o-hoo)\nLiving under your spotlight\nMaybe if you treat me right\nYou won't have to worry\n\nIs this a relationship\nFulfilling your needs as well as mine?\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\nOr is this just my sentence\nAm I doing time?\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\nIf this is love, real, real love\nThen I'm staying no doubt\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\nBut if I'm just love's prisoner\nThen I'm busting out (oh)\nIs that you? Is that you? Is that you?\n\nWell, I don't like (o-hoo)\nLiving under your spotlight (o-hoo)\nJust because you think I might (o-hoo)\nFind somebody worthy\nOh, I don't like (o-hoo)\nLiving under your spotlight\nMaybe if you treat me right\nYou won't have to worry\n\nOh, you ought to be ashamed of yourself\nWhat the hell do you think you're doing\nLoving me, loving me so wrong?\nBaby, all I do is try (try)\nTo show you that you're mine (mine)\nOne and only guy (only guy)\nNo matter who may come along\nOpen your eyes 'cause, baby, I don't like\nOoh, ooh (oh, oh)\nOoh, ooh (hey, 'cause I don't like!)\n\nWell, I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight (no, no)\nJust because you think I might (hee)\nFind somebody worthy (no, I don't like, yeah)\nAnd I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight\n(Living under your spotlight)\nMaybe if you treat me right\n(Treat me right, yeah!)\nYou won't have to worry\n\n(I don't like)"}
