Now you're gonna shout about it\nNo! No more! Yeah yeah this is the end\n\nThe silence is broken now\nIt's over now\nThe words have been spoken\nAnd with every word you say\nYou blow away\nThe tears of another time\n\nFace to face\nAnyone can see you're not\nThe child you were before\n\nNow I lay you down\n\nYou take your place\nNo one can take away your heart\nOh no! There can be no doubt about it\nNo! No more! Yeah yeah this is the end\n\nThe silence is broken now\nIt's over now\nThe truth has been spoken\nAnd with every word you say\nYou blow away\nYeah\n\nNever again\nYou say the words and let\nThe sunshine in again\nYou can change the world\nNo one can take away your heart\n\nThe silence is broken now\nIt's over now\nThe words have been spoken\nAnd with every word you say\nYou blow away\nThe tears of another time\n\nThe silence is broken now\nIt's over now\nThe truth has been spoken\nAnd with every word you say\nYou blow away\nThe scene of another crime"}
