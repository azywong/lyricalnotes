LaTocha Scott)\n\n[Chorus:]\nYou say your having a baby\nBut I don't know if it's mine\nIt all started from a one night stand\nIt wasn't part of the plan\nBut now I see you got an attitude\nAnd you're so confused\nYou didn't tell me 'bout your man at home\nSo what you gonna do?\n\n[Verse 1: J-Shin]\nChillin' in the club on a Saturday night\nSaw you across the floor you were looking so fly\nI can't believe that you were also looking my way\nYes you were, yes you were\nSo I stepped to you with my game down tight\nBefore we knew it, it was on for tonight\nSo now tell me what's goin' on with you lady\n\n[Bridge: J-Shin]\nSo tell me what's going on\nPlease don't make me wait\nI know you're living with your man\nSleeping with your man\nCreepin' with your friends\nSaying you wanna get with me\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2: LaTocha]\nNow boy you know just as well as I do\nIn order to go half on a baby, it takes two\nYes it does, yes it does, yes it does\nAnd even though I had a man at home\nAll we ever did was fuss and fight\nThings just wasn't right\nSick and tired of being mistreated\nNeglected for no reason\nWhen love was all I needed\nHe didn't care, so I cheated\n\n[Bridge 2: J-Shin]\nSo this is what's going on\nBaby girl, please don't play\nI know you're living with your man\nSleeping with your man\nCreepin' with your friends\nSaying you wanna get with me\n\n[Chorus]\n[Break:]\n[LaTocha:] See I know it was never meant to, be you and me\nBut it's so hard, so hard for me to believe\nThat I'm having your baby, and it's driving me crazy\n[J-Shin:] Okay now, I'ma step up and be a real man\nBut you have to really have to tell me where I stand\nCuz if this is mine (it's yours)\nGirl I'm ready (are you ready?)\nTo take responsibility\n\n[Chorus & Ad-Libs to fade]"}
