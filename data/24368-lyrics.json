Baby don't be afraid\nI'mma hurt you real good baby\n\nLet's go, it's my show, baby do what I say\nDon't trip off the bits that I'm gonna display\nI told ya I'mma hold ya down until you're amazed\nGive it to ya 'til you're screaming my name\n\nNo escapin' when I start \nOnce I'm in I own your heart\nThere's no way you'll ring the alarm\nSo hold on until it's over\n\nOh! Do you know what you got into?\nCan you handle what I'm 'bout to do?\n'cause it's about to get rough for you\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nOh! I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet\nYou thought an angel swept ya off your feet\nWell I'm about to turn up the heat\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nIt's alright, you'll be fine, baby I'm in control\nTake the pain, take the pleasure \nI'm the master of both\nClose your eyes, not your mind\nLet me into your soul\nI'mma work it 'til you're totally blown\n\nNo escapin' when I start \nOnce I'm in I own your heart \nThere's no way you'll ring the alarm\nSo hold on until it's over\n\nOh! Do you know what you got into \nCan you handle what I'm 'bout to do\n'cause it's about to get rough for you\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nOh! I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet\nYou thought an angel swept you off your feet\nWell I'm about to turn up the heat\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nWhoa-oh! Do you like what you see?\nWhoa-oh! Let me entertain you til you scream!\n\nOh! Do you know what you got into? \nCan you handle what I'm 'bout to do?\n'cause it's about to get rough for you\nI'm here for your entertainment\n\nOh! I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet\nYour fallen angel swept you off your feet\nWell I'm about to turn up the heat\nI'm here for your entertainment"}
