(you know?)\nI, I guess right now we should start the show\n\n[Verse 1: Guru]\nWho's the suspicious character\nStrapped with the sounds profound\nSimilar to rounds spit by Derringers\nYou're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said\nIt's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads\n‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties\nWhile real MC's and DJ's are a minority\nBut right about now, I use my authority\n‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy\nThe horror be when I return for my real people\nWords that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles\nSporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks\nSubtracting all the rappers who lack\nOver Premier's tracks\nSevere facts have brought this rap game to near collapse\nSo as I have in the past, I whoop ass\nDropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax\nAnd one-dimensional MC's can't handle that\nWhile the world's revolving, on its axis\nI come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics\nThe wilderness is filled with this\nSo many people searching for false bliss\nI'm here with the skills you've missed\nThe rejected stone is now the cornerstone\nSort of like the master builder when I make my way home\nYou know my steez\n\n[Hook]\nYou know my steez\nLet 'em know, do your thing, dog\nKeep it live (Keep it live,Keep it live)\nTo the beat y'all\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax\nI'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax\nI be bringing salvation through the way that I rap\nAnd you know, and I know, I'm nice like that\nWork through worldly problems, I got the healing power\nWhen the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power\nStealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour\nIt's often easier for one to give advice\nThan it is for a person to run one's own life\nThat's why I can't be caught up in all the hype\nI keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight\nThe apparatus gets blessed\nAnd suckers get put to rest\nNo more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess\nThe wackness is spreading like the plague\nMC's lucked up and got paid\nBut still can't make the fucking grade\nHow many times are wannabe's gonna lie?\nYo, they must wanna fry\nThey can't touch the knowledge I personify\nI travel through the darkness, carrying my torch\nThe illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort\n(You know my steez)\nYou know my steez\n\n[Hook]\nLet em know, do your thing y'all\nKeep it live (Keep it live)\nYou know my steez\nLet em know, do your thing y'all\nKeep it live (Keep it live)\nYou know my steez\nLet em know, do your thing y'all\nKeep it live (Keep it live)\nYou know my steez\nLet em know, do your thing y'all\nKeep it live (Keep it live)\nThe mic\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet\nSome punks ain't paid all of their debts yet\nTrying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set\nWith juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats\nBig deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel\nStyles more tangible, and image more real\nFor some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts\nWhen it's time to go all out you be like, \"Damn, he flipped!\"\nNow I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit\nGot the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip\nDon't trip, it's the gifted prolific one\nKnown as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick?\nMy style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot\nDon't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot\nStyles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas\nYo, them motherfuckers are harrassable\nFor I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond\nThe mic's either a magic wand\nOr it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb\nThen I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone\nAnd if you thought we'd lose our niche\nIn this rap shit, you way wrong\nI stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon\nYour song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon\nFat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on\nWord is bond\nYou know my steez"}
