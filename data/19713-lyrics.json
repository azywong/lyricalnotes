I can't lie to myself\nAnd there's a storm that's raging\nthrough my frozen heart tonight\nI ain't missing you at all\nI ain't missing you...missing you\nI ain't missing you, oh no\nI ain't missing you, I ain't missing you\nI ain't missing you, I ain't missing you...\nEverytime I think of you, I always catch my breath.\n"}
