I'm staring at you now\nThere's no one else around\nI'm thinking you're the girl I need\nI'm just saying it's fine by me\nIf you never leave\nAnd we can live like this forever\nIt's fine by me\nI'm just saying it's fine by me\nIf you never leave\nAnd we can live like this forever\nIt's fine by me\nAnd it's never easy\nDarling, believe me\nI'm as sceptical as you\nWhen I think of life without 'us'\nShe's like \"what we supposed to do?\"\nBut I don't wanna come on too strong\nI'm just saying it's fine by me\nIf you never leave\nWe can live like this forever\nIt's fine by me\nIt's fine by me if you never leave\nAnd we can live? like this forever\nIt's fine by me\nI'm just saying it's fine by me\nIf we never leave\nAnd we can live like this forever\nIt's fine by me"}
