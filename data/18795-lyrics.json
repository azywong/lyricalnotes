Sdtrk.)\n\nchorus:\nYou don't have to worry\nI won't waste your time\nI ain't satisfied\nYou don't have to worry\nI won't waste your time\nI ain't satisfied\n\nLove is made,\nMade of many things\nAnd one of them is trust\nBut I can't trust you anymore\nThings you say (say) how about the things you do?\nThey won't hurt me, no\nThey won't hurt me anymore\n\n~chorus~\n\nLove can make,\nMake a stronger man\nBut you don't love me\n(You don't love me)\nAnd I don't feel you're always strong\nThe hearts you break\nWith your simple lies\nAnd you better watch out baby\nThe next heart may be your own\n\nI gave you\nMy love, my life, my time\nMine was your own\nThough you stripped me to the bone\nWhen I asked you how you feel,\nIf our love was the deal\nYou told me, we got it goin' on\nNow I feel that love is gone\n\n~chorus~\n\nI'm alright,\nI'm alright\nI gave you\nMy love, my heart and soul\nYou took my love\nNow you want to take control\nWhen a good thing comes your way\nWhy can't you stay\nI can't go on another day\n\n~repeat chorus~\n\nYou know I'm gonna be alright\nYou know I'm gonna be alright\nYou know I'm gonna be alright\nWhy why why\nYou know I'm gonna be alright\nYou know I ain't satisfied\nYou know I'm gonna be alright"}
