I felt like I know him\nAnd I know his heart, and I know what\nHe wouldn't do to hurt me\nBut I didn't realize that I feeling so confident\nAnd feeling so great about myself\nAnd then it just be completely shattered\nBy one thing. By something so stupid\nBut then he'd make me feel crazy\nMake me feel like it's my fault\nI was in pain\"\n\nYou got me sippin' on something\nI can't compare to nothing\nI've ever known, I'm hoping\nThat after this fever, I'll survive\n\nI know I'm acting a bit crazy\nStrung out, a little bit hazy\nHand over heart, I'm praying\nThat I'm gonna make it out alive\n\nThe bed's getting cold and you're not here\nThe future that we hold is so unclear\nBut I'm not alive until you call\nAnd I'll bet the odd's against it all\n\nSave your advice, 'cause I won't hear\nYou might be right, but I don't care\nThere's a million reasons why I should give you up\nBut the heart wants what it wants\n\nThe heart wants what it wants\n\nYou got me scattered in pieces\nShining like stars and screaming\nLighting me up like Venus\nBut then you'd disappear and make me wait\n\nAnd every second's like torture\nHell over trip, no more so\nFinding a way to let go\nBaby, baby, no, I can't escape\n\nThe bed's getting cold and you're not here\nThe future that we hold is so unclear\nBut I'm not alive until you call\nAnd I'll bet the odd's against it all\n\nSave your advice, 'cause I won't hear\nYou might be right, but I don't care\nThere's a million reasons why I should give you up\nBut the heart wants what it wants\n\nThe heart wants what it wants\nThe heart wants what it wants\nThe heart wants what it wants\n\nThis is a modern fairytale\nNo happy ending, no wind in our sails\nBut I can't imagine a life without\nThe breathless moments breaking me down\nDown, down, down\n\nThe bed's getting cold and you're not here\nThe future that we hold is so unclear\nBut I'm not alive until you call\nAnd I'll bet the odd's against it all\n\nSave your advice, 'cause I won't hear\nYou might be right, but I don't care\nThere's a million reasons why I should give you up\nBut the heart wants what it wants\n\nThe heart wants what it wants\nThe heart wants what it wants\nThe heart wants what it wants"}
