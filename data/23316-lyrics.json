I can't win\n\nSo sacrifice yourself\nAnd let me have what's left\nI know that I can find\nthe fire in your eyes.\nI'm going it all away,\nget away, please.\n\n[Chorus]\nYou take the breath right out of me\nYou left a hole where my heart should be\nYou got to fight just to make it through\nCause I will be the death of you\n\nThis will be all over soon\nPour salt into the open wound\nIs it over yet? Let me in\n\nSo sacrifice yourself\nand let me have what's left\nI know that I can find\nthe fire in your eyes\nI'm going it all away\nget away, please\n\n[Chorus]\nYou take the breath right out of me.\nYou left a hole where my heart should be.\nYou got to fight just to make it through,\nCause I will be the death of you.\n\nI'm waiting, I'm prayin\nRealize. Start hiding!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou take the breath right out of me.\nYou left a hole where my heart should be.\nYou got to fight just to make it through,\nCause I will be the death of you."}
