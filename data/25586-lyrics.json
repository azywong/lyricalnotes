Do ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\n\nNo, I don't like you, \nI just thought you were cool enough to kick it\nGot a beach house I could sell you in Idaho\nSince you think I don't love you, \nI just thought you were cute\nThat's why I kiss you\nGot a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though\n\nI'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you\n(Ooh, no, no, no)\nI've been thinkin' 'bout you\n(You know, know, know)\nI've been thinkin' 'bout you\nDo you think about me still?\nDo ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\n\nYes, of course\nI remember, how could I forget?\nHow you feel?\nAnd though you were my first time\nA new feel\nIt won't ever get old, not in my soul\nNot in my spirit, keep it alive\nWe'll go down this road\n'Til it turns from color to black and white\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)"}
