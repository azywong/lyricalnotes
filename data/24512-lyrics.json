I'll never date an actress\nGot too many back zits\nPlus, my whole home aroma is cat piss\nEvery show I do is poorly promoted\nAnd if you like this\nIt's cause my little sister wrote it\n\n[Hook]\nMotherfucker, I'm awesome!\nNo you're not, dude, don't lie\nI'm awesome!\nI'm drivin' around in my mom's ride\nI'm awesome!\nA quarter of my life gone by\nAnd I met all my friends online\nMotherfucker, I'm awesome!\nI will run away from a brawl\nI'm awesome!\nThere's no voice mail, nobody called\nI'm awesome!\nI can't afford to buy eight balls\nAnd I talk to myself on my Facebook wall\n\n[Scratching]\nThe swagger of a cripple\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheck it out\nI'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)\nAnd I can't ski\nSmoke weed but I can't roll blunts\nFind me whipped by my wifey\nMy neck not icy\nEatin' at McDonalds because Subway's pricey\nHa, and my uni-brow is plucked\nJust asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks\nShe's like, \"For what?\nBlunt wraps and some Heinekens?\nYou skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!\"\nI'm like, \"Mom please, don't blame it on me\nI got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve.\"\nMy attitude's sour but my futon's sweet\nAnd the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji\nSuit un-tailored, ringtone Taylor Swift\nCan't tweet up on my Twitter\n'Cause I haven't done shit\nBank account red, body ungroomed\nThe only good thing about me is I'm off stage soon\n\n[Hook]\nI'm awesome!\nNo you're not, dude don't lie\nI'm awesome!\nI'm drivin' around in my mom's ride\nI'm awesome!\nA quarter of my life gone by\nAnd I met all my friends online\nMotherfucker, I'm awesome!\nI will run away from a brawl\nI'm awesome!\nThere's no voice mail, nobody called\nI'm awesome!\nI can't afford to buy eight balls\nAnd I talk to myself on my Facebook wall\nI'm awesome\n\n[Scratched]\nSuit untailored, ringtone Taylor Swift\n\n[Verse 3]\nFurthermore I am cornier than Ethanol\nCheesier than Provolone\nI spent ages eight to ten living in a motor home\nWith a ego the size of Tim Duncan\nEven though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin\nI'm twenty four, serving lobster rolls\nBecause I spent a decade filling Optimos\nAnd I'm not even the bomb in Maine\nOn my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain\nNow put your hands up\nIf you have nightmares\nIf you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here\nIf you got dandruff\nIf you drink light beer\nI'm outta breath\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm awesome!\nNo you're not, dude don't lie\nI'm awesome!\nI'm drivin' around in my mom's ride\nI'm awesome!\nA quarter of my life gone by\nAnd I met all my friends online\nMotherfucker, I'm awesome!\nI will run away from a brawl\nI'm awesome!\nThere's no voice mail, nobody called\nI'm awesome!\nI can't afford to buy eight balls\nAnd I talk to myself on my Facebook wall\nI'm awesome"}
