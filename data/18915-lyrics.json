Kids At Play!\r\n\r\nThose were the rights of spring and we did everything\r\nThere was salvation every night\r\nWe got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn\r\nBut everything we tried was right\r\n\r\nShe used her body just like a bandage,\r\nShe used my body just like a wound\r\nI'll probably never know where she disappeared\r\nBut I can see her rising up out of the back seat now\r\nJust like an angel rising up from a tomb\r\n\r\nBut it was long ago and it was far away,\r\nOh God it seems so very far\r\nAnd if life is just a highway,\r\nThen the soul is just a car\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror\r\nMay appear closer than they are\r\n\r\nShe used her body just like a bandage,\r\nShe used my body just like a wound\r\nI'll probably never know where she disappeared\r\nBut I can see her rising up out of the back seat now"}
