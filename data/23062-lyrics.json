That is the question\nBut I forget, you don't expect an easy answer\nWhen something like a soul becomes\nInitialized and folded up like paper dolls and little notes\nYou can't expect a bit of hopes\nSo while you're outside looking in\nDescribing what you see\nRemember what you're staring at is me\n\nCause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever\nNo one ever tells you that forever\nFeels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\nHow much is real? So much to question\nAn epidemic of the mannequins\nContaminating everything\nWhen thought came from the heart\nIt never did right from the start\nJust listen to the noises\n(Null and void instead of voices)\nBefore you tell yourself it's just a different scene\nRemember it's just different from what you've seen\n\nI'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAnd all I know is that it feels like forever\nNo one ever tells you that forever\nFeels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\nCause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever\nNo one ever tells you that forever\nFeels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah\n\nI'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nOh God, it feels like forever\nBut no one ever tells you that forever\nFeels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\nCause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever\nBut no one ever tells you that forever\nFeels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you, yeah\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah\n\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you, yeah\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah\n\nOh, and the stars\nOh, and the stars they lie"}
