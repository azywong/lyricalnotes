just want to thank everybody for being so patient\nSnd bearing with me over these last couple of years\nEhile I figure this shit out\n\nIs anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself\nNo one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from\nCan anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself\nIt feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\n\nSo why in the world do I feel so alone\nNobody but me, I'm on my own\nIs there anyone out there who feels the way I feel\nIf there is then let me hear\nJust so I know that I'm not the only one\n\nI went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes\nBut there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains\nHatred was flowin' through my veins\nOn the verge of goin' insane\nI almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne\n\nIt's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'\nI felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'\nAnd I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then could have got it\nAlmost went at Kanye too, God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic\n\nThank God that I didn't do it\nI'da had my ass handed to me and I knew it\nBut Proof isn't here to see me through it\nI'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryin' to talk myself into it\n\nAre you stupid, you gon' start dissin' people for no reason?\n'Specially when you can't even write a decent punch line even\nYou're lyin' to yourself, your slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health\nIs declining with your self-esteem, your crying out for help\n\nIs anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself\nNo one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from\nCan anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself\nIt feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy\n\nSo why in the world do I feel so alone\nNobody but me, I'm on my own\nIs there anyone out there who feels the way I feel\nIf there is then let me hear\nJust so I know that I'm not the only one\n\nMarshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow\nAll I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathin' and hollow\nBottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow\nMy sorrow echos in this hall though (oh-oh-whoa)\n\nBut I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else\n(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)\nBut all these other rappers suck is all that I know\nI've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado\n\nBut Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto\nHe's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled\nInside him, one foot on the break, one on the throttle\nFallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's\n\nBut instead of feelin' sorry for yourself, do somethin' bout it\nAdmit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted\nLong enough, it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby\nQuit worryin' about what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy\n\nIs anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself\nNo one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from\nCan anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself\nIt feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy\n\nSo why in the world do I feel so alone\nNobody but me, I'm on my own\nIs there anyone out there who feels the way I feel\nIf there is then let me hear\nJust so I know that im not the only one\n\nSo I picked myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned\nHit my bottom so hard, I bounced twice, suffice this time around\nIt's different, them last two albums didn't count\nEncore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' em out\n\nI've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around\nI got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down\nSo please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal\nI feel like me again, let me formally\n\nReintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know\nThe new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no\nSigns of slowin' up, oh, and I'm blowin' up all over\nMy life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over, homos\n\nI'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep your head up\nT.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up, don't let up\nJust keep slayin' em, rest in peace to DJ AM\n'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um\n\nIs anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself\nNo one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from\nCan anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself\nIt feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy\n\nSo why in the world do I feel so alone\nNobody but me, I'm on my own\nIs there anyone out there who feels the way I feel\nIf there is then let me hear\nJust so I know that I'm not the only one\n\nSo there it is, damn\nIt feels like I just woke up or something\nI guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man\nHey yo, and to anybody that I thought about going at\nIt was never nothin' personal; it was jus' some shit I was going through\nAnd to everybody else... I'm back, heh"}
