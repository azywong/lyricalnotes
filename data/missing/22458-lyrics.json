Olu Dara)\n\n*Nas talking*\n\"The light is there.\"\n\n(Intro: Olu Dara singing)\nSee I come from Mississippi\nI was young and runnin' wild\nEnded up in New York City, where I had my first child\nI named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas\nI told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive\n\n(Verse 1: Nas)\nLet's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --\nTribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered\nMany brothers snatched it up and tried to match it\nBut I'm still number one, everyday real\nSpeak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel\n'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss\nKeep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi\nDid it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy\nBridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap\nThe history of music on this track\nBorn in the game, discovered my father's music\nLike Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain\nBut my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids\nSome are well-known, some doin' bids\nI mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks\nIf Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo\n(Olu Dara singing)\nGreatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)\nGre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!\n\n(Verse 2: Nas)\nThe blues came from gospel, gospel from blues\nSlaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's\nOld school, new school, know school rules\nAll these years I been voicin' my blues\nI'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart\nGraffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent\nBut Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with\nBooks to read, like X and stuff\n'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia\nIn art class I was a compulsive sketcher of\nTeachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up\n'Cause none'a them would like my style\nRead more books than the curriculum profile\nSaid, \"Mr. Jones please come get your child\n'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild\"\n(Olu Dara singing)\nGreatest man - The great-greatest man alive\n\n(Verse 3: Nas)\nHey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone\nHe been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home\nThen he got grown, changed his name to Olu\nCome on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to\n(Olu Dara singing)\nI been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique\nMadagascar, Paris, Greece\nThe Middle Africa is where we lived\nBetter known as Queenbridge\n(Nas)\nNas, Nas you don't stop\nOlu Dara in the house, you don't stop\nMuddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop\nFrom the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop\nTell 'em Pop\n\n(Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing)\nSee I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)\nI was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)\nEnded up in New York City (Yeah!)\nWhere I had my first child (That's me)\nI named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)\nAll the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)\nI told him as a youngster\nHe'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)\nGreatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop) Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!\nRest In Peace Ray Charles"}
