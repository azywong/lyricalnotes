Really ponderous...\n\nI had this dream the other night...\nI went to work one day... And nobody remembered who I was...\nSo, I decided to take the day off...\nOn my way out, I run into my boss and he say's, \"hey, you look familiar...\"\nI said, \"thanks, people say that a lot in these dreams.\"\nThen the horns kicked in (sfx) and my shoes started to squeak. (sfx)\n\nThen all of a sudden, I'm standing on a beach in some tropical part of the world... and there's this sign that says... \"aren't you supposed to be at work...\" (haha) it sort of screamed out at me... (scream)...\n\nThen I remembered, I'd been here in other dreams, but usually there was a water polo game and a girl who could talk with her eyes... And she'd say... \"can you see what I'm saying?\" then the horn kicked in (sfx) and my shoes started to squeak...(sfx)\n\nBefore I knew it... I was walking near a lake when a phone rings (sfx) and the operator speaks to me in a language I don't understand...\n\nOom papachucka maka nanu singow.\nMeling kapalana wani domo chingpow...\nHeddy kapalua cuma jenising tea...\nOomama chucka pana one is now three...\n\nThen the horns kicked in. (sfx) and my shoes started to squeak (sfx)\n\nBefore long, I was coming up on this weird part of my dream... You know, the part where I know how to tap dance... But I can only do it while wearing golf shoes...\n\nNow, I'm back on the beach... Walking with this girl who talks with her eyes. This time she say's. \"i think you see what I'm saying...\"\n\nThen just before I woke up. It started to rain in southern California...\n\nA girl who could talk with her eyes...\n\nCan you see what I'm saying?\n\nAren't you supposed to be at work? (haha.)\n\nThis is ponderous man... Really ponderous...\n\nOoh (horns)\n\n(Squeak sfx)"}
