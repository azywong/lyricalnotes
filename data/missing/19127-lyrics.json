It's gon' be a long night\n\nThrow your clothes (throw your clothes) on the floor (on the floor)\nI'm gonna take my clothes off too\nI've made plans to be with you\nGirl, whatever you ask me, you know I can do\n\nI'll make love to you\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight\nBaby, all through the night\n\nI'll make love to you\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go\nTill you tell me to\n\nBaby, tonight is your night\nAnd I will do you right\nJust make a wish on your night\nAnything that you ask\nI will give you the love of your life\nYour life, your life\n\nI'll make love to you\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight\nBaby, all through the night\n\nI'll make love to you (I'll make love)\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go\nTill you tell me to\n\nI'll make love to you (I'll make love)\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight (hold you tight)\nBaby, all through the night\n\nI'll make love to you (I'll make love)\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go\nTill you tell me to"}
