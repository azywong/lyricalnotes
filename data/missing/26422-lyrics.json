Look at her butt. Ew!\nOh, she looks like a slut. Ew!\nI'm like \"what the what\"? Ew!\nRight? Right? Ew, ew!\n\nOh, you got to see this\nOh my gross I can't believe it\nShe's so basically basic\nShe's literally making me sick\n\nThis is embarrassing. Ew, ew!\nLike seriously, seriously. Ew, ew!\nNo, seriously, seriously! Ew, ew!\nI can't, I can't! Ew, ew!\n\n(Verse 1 - Will.I.Am & Jimmy Fallon:)\nLook at look at this. OM-effin-G, what the eff?\nYou're gonna freakin' flip, like, seriously freakin' flip\nCause Sally's mad at Iggy because Iggy's booty's more biggy\nAnd Sally's booty's twiggy so she called her friend Cybie\nNow Sally's gonna get impleggies\nWhat's impleggies? Implants, silly. Ew!\nI'm freakin' for real\nI think silicone butts are ew, ew!\n\n(Hook 2 - Will.I.Am & Jimmy Fallon:)\nWhere'd she get that outfit? Ew\nThat girl is totally ratchet. Ew!\nNo, seriously - who likes that? Ew!\nRight right? Ew, ew!\n\nLook at the way she takes pics\nAnd what's up with those duck lips?\nShe's so lame\nSuper lame. Ew, ew!\n\nThis is embarrassing. Ew, ew!\nLike seriously seriously. Ew, ew!\nNo, seriously seriously. Ew, ew!\nOh my gosh. Ew, ew!\n\n(Bridge - Will.I.Am:)\nI am not hating\nI am merely conversating\nWith my BFF Sara\nSo bust your rhyme, Sara...\n\n(Verse 2 - Jimmy Fallon & Will.I.Am:)\nIt's Mir.I.Am and you know who\nNow here's some things I think are ew!\nFaceTime and reclining in\nAirplane seats and then Vining\nRetweeting tweets I'm not lying\nCause even rhyming's ann-iy-ing!\nBread bowls and ravioli\nCasserole, a roly poly\nCaterpillar on my really old\nAnd moldy windowsill. Ew!\nTrapper keepers and a creeper wearin'\nSneakers with the toes\nAnd maybe Frozen cause\nYou knowin' I don't\nWanna build a snowman. Ew, ew!\n\nEw, ew, ew, ew, ew!\n\nEw, ew, ew. Like seriously? Ew\n\nHello my name is Sara\nThat's Sara with no \"H\"\nToo bad if you don't like it\nCause haters gonna\nHate my Stepdad Gary\nHe tries to act so cool\nEvery time we see him\nMy friends and I say \"Ew!\"\n\n(Outro - Stepdad Gary, Will.I.Am & Jimmy Fallon:)\nHey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?\n\nOh my gosh, it's my step dad Gary\nAnd he just ruined it!\n\nI heard that funky beat that you was playing down here\nIt's a party over here\nIt's a party over here\n\nEw!"}
