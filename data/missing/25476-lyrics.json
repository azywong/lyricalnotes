'Cause\n\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\n\n(Verse 2: Drake)\nSmoking weed under star projectors\nI guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us\nBut seeing my family have it all\nTook the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall\n\nAnd really I think I like who I'm becoming\nThere's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing\nThere's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation\nFor all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience\n\nI got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me\nThe same ones that'll come up off the hip for me\nThe realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me\nI told my story, then made history\n\nTell them imma need reservations for 20\nI've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah\nI'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathing\nThat OVO and XO is everything you believe in, I know\n\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\n\n'Cause we blowing like a C4\nGot my whole crew blowing like a C4\nSo broadcast that, nigga we the news in the city"}
