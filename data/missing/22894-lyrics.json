Tell me when to go...\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nGo dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\n(Verse 1: E-40)\nOoh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em\nI ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some\nImagine all the Hebrews going dumb\nDancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones (eeerrrrr!)\nOoh, tell me when to go (dumb)\nTalking on my Ghettro on the way to the store\n... My 2nd or 3rd trip\nSome Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips\nDr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts\nNot just the cops, but the homies you got to watch\nThe moon is full, look at the dark clouds\nSitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild... Ta-dow\nI don't bump mainstream, I knock underground\nAll that other shit, sugar-coated and watered down\nI'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb\nFrom the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nGo dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\n(Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak)\nI'm off that 18 dummy juice\n... Yadamean, labeled the Black Zeus\nKing of the super dooper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)\nAnd your wife, she don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me)\n>From the Bay to the A\nPut me in the back wood, Swisher sweet bud, orange lace (Let's go, it's dope)\nBitches wish I wrote, I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)\nI slid past on the gas, bitches looking at me\nIt's good, it's good like the granddaddy\nCross game, you get flipped like a burger patty\nOr zig-zagged... pass me a big old fatty\n... I drink white, with a snow bunny\nTalking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy\n1800, Jose Cuervo\nYadada mean, yadada I'm saying though\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nGo dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\n(Outro: E-40)\n(X4) Ghost-ride the whip\n(X8) Now... Scrape\n(X4) Put your stunna shades on\n(X2) Now... Gas, brake, dip, dip\n(X4) Shake them dreads\n(X4) Let me see you show your grill\n(X4) Now... Thizz face\n(X4) Doors open, mayne\n(X4) Now... Watch 'em swang\n(X2) Go stupid, go (dumb, dumb)\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go...\nGo dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb"}
