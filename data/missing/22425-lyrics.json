(I'll be loving you)\n\nWanna keep you flawed with no dough\nPimpin' ain't easy\nTrust me I know\nWhen gangstas and hos\nGo go go go go go together\nLike chinchilla and bad weather\nI'm good but been better\nAll my bros, chedda and glamorous things\nCopped a few cars\nA crib with a east and west wing\n'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets\nOf how to get it and keep it\nHow to prey on my weakness\nIt's the power of the p-u-s-s-y\nGot a lotta niggas wonderin it ain't just i\nGotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life\nIf it wasn't for the money and the things I got\nShit, she probably wouldn't like me\nBut I keep her and irv and Jeffrey quite icy\nSip seraphin\nWho doesn't like me\nAnd the murderous I-n-c\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\n\nHow many girls does it take to get to\nMack status?\nPlayer status?\nPimps that get\nYa boy half rich fore we hit show biz\nBut show biz brought next level chicks\nPull them in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga\nI came from the dirt what you want me to say\nI'm at the top of the world and lifes a pussy buffet\nAnd that's why I get m-i-a\nShut the game down so the bustas can't play\nHell yeah I splurge money\nHell yeah I act funny\nLook at you like fuck you\nAll the shit I been through\nIt's a wonder why I'm still here\nSaid I was gone but I'm still here\nAnd all you bitches that left me here\nIt's mighty strange how you right back here\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\n\nI wonder why love is about money\nAnd why wou wanna take it all from me\nHoney\nMy life is dark but it's lovely\nCrimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?\n(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)\nY'all bitches don't know\nMoney ain't a thang\nMami need a lil change\nGirl I'm pitchin quarters\nClosest to the arches but live in a fortress\nNew Benzes new Porsches\nNew cases new lawyers\nI'm becoming the infamous notorious rule\nNiggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\nNiggas don't possess the heart that I do\nAnd it's a wonder that I'm still here\nThought I was gone but I'm still here\nAnd all you bitches that left me here\nIt's kinda funny how you right back there\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\n\nOh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh"}
