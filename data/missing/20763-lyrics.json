Fox was Alex P. Keaton\nWhen I met you, I said my name was Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer, since that summer\n\nCherry Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie\nUsed to hate school so I had to play hookie\nAlways been hip to the B-boy style\nKnown to act wild and make girls smile\n\nLove New Edition and the Candy Girl\nRemind me of you because you rock my world\nYou come from Georgia where the peaches grow\nThey drink lemonade and speak real slow\n\nYou love hip hop and rock 'n' roll\nDad took off when you were four years old\nThere was a good man named Paul Revere\nI feel much better, baby, when you're near\n\nYou love fun dip and cherry coke\nI like the way you laugh when I tell a joke\nWhen I met you I said my name was Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer, since that summer\n\nIn the summertime girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\n\nBugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks\nMy mind takes me back there, oh, so quick\nLet you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit\nThink about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it\n\nLike the color purple, macaroni and cheese\nRuby red slippers and a bunch of trees\nCall you up but what's the use\nI like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose\n\nCame in the door said it before\nI think I'm over you but I'm really not sure\nWhen I met you I said my name was Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer, since that summer\n\n'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worth while and some are so so\nSummer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worth while and some are so so\n\nSummertime girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer, since that summer"}
