(DONT STOP)\n\nI'm the dream, I'm the one\nI'm the reason you come, I'm a king\nI'm a hum, I'm a beast\nI'm the last thing your eyes see\nThe passion beside me is yours now come try me\n\nTell me\nWhat you thinkin' about when your hands is all on me\n'Cause I 've been thinking about all the possibilities\nAin't no other place that I really wanna be\n'Cause you swept me off my feet\n\nBoy I got my eyes on you\nTell me what you wanna do\nI can picture you in my room\nUntil the mornin\nI don't even know your name\nBoy I need to know your name\nI'm hopin that you feel the same\nTell me if you want it\n\nI know you gonna like it (I know)\nSo tell me how you want it (tell me)\nAnd you don't have to fight (you know)\n'Cause baby you're invited (baby)\nI know you gonna like it (I know)\nSo tell me how you want it (tell me)\nBut you don't have to FIGHT it... you know\nBaby you're INVITED... babe\n\nTell me\nWhat you thinkin' about when your hands is all on me\n'Cause I 've been thinking about all the possibilities\nAin't no other place that I really wanna be\n'Cause you swept me off my feet\n\nDo that - do that - do it\nDo that - do that - do it\nDo that - do that - do it\nDo that - do that - do it"}
