Baby A.K.A. crazy\nTrapped in a maze, therefore I am amazing\nBlock E the doc, I'm just a patient\nAnd even with Navigation, I'm lost on a...\n\nHook: Gorilla Zoe and Lil Wayne\nI'm lost on a road\nI... I... I don't know what's wrong with me\nBut... but I'm a keep that styrofoam with me\nI'm lost on a road\nAnd I don't know what's wrong with me\nGorilla Zoe on the song with me\nHe must be gone with me\n\nGorilla Zoe\nI'm makin' this money, just to go spend it\nLivin' the good life, hope nobody ends it\nBut who are you kidding?\nAy who are you lying to?\nYou know if they want you best believe they will find you\n\nI'm lost on a road\nAnd there's no one to talk to\nThere's nowhere to run to\nI'm goin' in circles\nI'm talkin' to myself\nGot me blazin' this purple"}
