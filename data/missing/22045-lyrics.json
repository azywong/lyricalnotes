(Shout louder!)\n\nLetting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\nNobody can hold us down\nNobody can hold us down\nNobody can hold us down\nNever can, never will\n\nSo what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying\nAre you offended with the message I'm bringing\nCall me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing\nGuess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing\n\nIf you look back in history\nIt's a common double standard of society\nThe guy gets all, the glory the more he can score\nWhile the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore\n\nI don't understand why it's okay\nThe guy can get away with it and the girl gets named\nAll my ladies come together and make a change\nStart a new beginning for us everybody sing\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)\nThinking all women should be seen, not heard\nWhat do we do girls? (Shout louder!)\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground\nSo lift your hands high and wave 'em proud\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\nCheck it\n\nNow here's something I just can't understand\nIf the guy have three girls then he's the man\nHe can even give her some head, or sex her off\nBut if a girl do the same, she's a whore\n\nBut the table's about to turn, I'll bet my fame on it\nCats take my ideas and put their name on it\nIt's all right though, you can't hold me down\nI got to keep on movin'\n\nTo my girls to their man who be trying to Mac\nDo it right back to him and let that be that\nYou need to let him know that his game is whack\nAnd Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back\n\nBut you're just a little boy\nThink you're so cute, so coy\nYou must talk so big\nTo make up for smaller things\n\nSo you're just a little boy\nAll you do is annoy\nYou must talk so big\nTo make up for smaller things (This is for my girls!)\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth\nThinking all women should be seen, not heard\nSo what do we do girls? (Shout louder!), shout louder\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho, ooh)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world (For my girls)\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Around the world!)\nThinking all women should be seen, not heard (Yeaheah)\nSo what do we do girls? (Shout louder!)\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand my ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\nSpread the word\nCan't hold us down\n\nYeah\nWe here\nBe back again\nYeah, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera\n\nYeah\nCan't hold us down!"}
