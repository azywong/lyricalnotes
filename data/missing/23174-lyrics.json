Blige\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\n\nLudacris\nNow little Lisa is only 9 years old\nShe's tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold\nWhy she's all all alone and they never met her family\nMamas always gone and she never met her daddy\nPart of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'\nMama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen\nBringin' home men at different hours of the night\nStartin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight\nSneak into her room while her mamas knocked out\nTryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'\nShe tries to resist but then all he does is beat her\nTries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her\nLisa is stuck up in the world on her own\nForced to think that hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack\nShe says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.\n\nMary J. Blige\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\n\nLudacris\nLittle Nicole is only 10 years old\nShe's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold\nWhy she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her\nAlcoholic step dad always wanna strike her\nYells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises\nTeachers ask questions she makin' up excuses\nBleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out\nThere's only one girl really knows what she about\nHer name is lil' Stacy and they become friends\nPromise that they always be tight till the end\nUntil one day lil' Stacy gets shot\nA drive by bullet went stray up on her block\nNow Nicole stuck up in the world on her own\nForced to think that hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but some get her clothes and pack\nShe says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.\n\nMary J. Blige\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\n\nLudacris\nLittle Erica is eleven years old\nShe's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold\nSo she pops x to get rid of all the pain\n'Cause she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen\nEmotions run deep and she thinks she's in love\nSo there's no protection hes usin' no glove\nNever thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions\nLivin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction\nThe days go by and her belly gets big\nThe father bails out he ain't ready for a kid\nKnowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion\nPlus she lives poor so no money for abortion\nErica is stuck up in the world on her own\nForced to think that hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack\nShe say she's 'bout to run away and never come back.\n\nMary J. Blige\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love\nRunaway love"}
