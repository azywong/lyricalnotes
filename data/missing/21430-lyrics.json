I mean I'm just sittin' right here.\nChecking out this young lady right here.\nBaby you hot.\nI mean you sexy. Oh my god!\nLet me ask you one question.\nWhere you from anyway?\"\n\nSinging:\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nShe's a rich girl, from the top of the food chain.\nLove and material things, kinda lonely.\nTill I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring.\nShe invites me to spend a day on the jet skis.\nAt first it didn't mean a thing.\nThen she told me I'm the one that she's searched for.\nIt was hard to believe.\n\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nIn a couple a days she had me a bracelet made.\nFrom Harry Winston's place.\nWent horseback up to the mountaintop.\nShowing me the land she's got.\nWell it's all right, but something else is on your mind.\nLooking past all that shines, now the tears are running through.\nAll those things are nice, but it's not why I'm here.\nI will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you.\n\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nTalking:\n\"And there you have it. I mean she just love the way I do my bling-bling\nFrom the ghetto to Beverly Hills baby!\nNow I want everybody on the dance floor to just shake it.\nMan, I want you to get down, 'cause we hot tonight baby!\nWe on fire!\nNow tell these cats where you from.\"\n\nSinging:\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.\nDrives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.\nLoves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.\n\nTalking:\n\"Como esta se&#xF1;orita!? Yaeh. We got Pretty Pras up in here.\nWe got Dante up in here. And it's on like that. That's right.\nNow all you cats that's talking that Jeebreeze, please stop it man!\nWe can't take it no more. Now tell them cats where you from baby.\nC'mon let 'em know.\"\n\nSinging:\nShe's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.\nHouse down by the water.
