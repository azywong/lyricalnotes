Like a heartbeat, drives you mad\n(Stillness...) In the stillness of remembering \n(Lonely...) What you had and what you lost \n(Oooh...) And what you had (Oooh...) \nOh, and what you lost (Oooh...)\n\nBoth\nThunder only happens when it's raining\nPlayers only love you when they're playin'\nI say, women, they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know\nYou'll know\n\nWill\nNow, here I go again: I see the crystal visions\nI keep my visions to myself\nBoth\nIt's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, and\nWill\nHave you any dreams you'd like to sell, dreams of loneliness?\nApril (Will)\n(Like a heartbeat...) Like a heartbeat, drives you mad\n(Stillness...) In the stillness of remembering \n(Lonely...) What you had and what you lost \n(Oooh...) And what you had (And what you had)\nOh, and what you lost (And what you lost...)\n\nBoth\nThunder only happens when it's raining\nPlayers only love you when they're playin'\nI say, women, they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know\nOh, thunder only happens when it's rainin\nPlayers only love you when they're playin'\nI say, women, they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know\nYou will know\nYou will know\nHey...you'll know"}
