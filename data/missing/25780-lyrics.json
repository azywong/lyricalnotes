Thank you\nYeah I'm so damn grateful\nI grew up really wanting gold fronts\nBut that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you\n\nY'all can't stop me\nI go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat\nAnd I'm eating at the beat\nLike you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week\n\n(Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye\nI've got a world to see;\nAnd my girl, she wanna see Rome\nCaesar'll make you a believer\nNah, I never ever did it for a throne\nThat validation comes\nSo I'm giving it back to the people now\nSing that song and it goes like\n\nRaise those hands, this is our party\nWe came here to live life like nobody was watching\nI got my city right behind me\nIf I fall, they got me\nLearn from that failure, gain humility\nAnd then we keep marching, I said\n\nHere we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nHere we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\n(And so we put our hands up)\n(And so we put our hands up)\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nHey, and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nHey, and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nOh, and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nMack-le-more\n\nHere we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nHere we go back, this is the moment\nTonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us"}
