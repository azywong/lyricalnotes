Southern nigga downer\nI wish you would bring your muthafuckin' ass around here\nWith that hip shit from your block\nYou fuck around and get shipped home to ya momma in a pine box\n'Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward\nWe got killas and hustlas and playas too, so nigga disregard\nWhat your seeing on them Western movies, 'cause yo!\nI ain't never rode a horse before, ho\nThink we slow? Smash the gas\nAnd watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass\nTry to load them dice, you'll meet the grave digger\n'Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga\nSee I done seen fools die for less\nThan a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set\nSo get that frown off your face busta\n'Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine, muthafucka\n\nWhat we see (what we see)\nEveryday (everyday)\nLivin' in the ghetto this is where I stay\n(What we do) what we do\n(To get by) to get by\nLive or die, I know the world is a ghetto"}
