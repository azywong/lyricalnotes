Love, love, love, love\nWhat time is love?\n\nI wanna see you sweat\nI wanna see you sweat\n\nOkay Houston\nWe'll give you a countdown\nFour, three, two, one, fire\n\nI wanna see you\n\nThe final chapter, prophetic, poetic\nWhen I'm done, this calls for anesthetic\nGet to, step to, let an MC\nCome in effect with Kingboy D\n\nA wanna be, gonna be, old time sucker\nYou know the time, I never stutter\nA feat, a dream, a yes seem bright\nYeah, pass the mic\n\nWhat time is love?\nWhat time is love?\nWhat time is love?\nWhat time is love?\n\nI wanna see you sweat\nI wanna see you sweat\nI wanna see you sweat"}
