Seeing your face no more on my pillow\nIs a scene that's never ever happened to me\n(Do you know?) But after this episode I don't see\nYou could never tell the next thing life could be\n\nDo you know what it feels like\nLoving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?\nDo you know what it feels like\nTo be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?\n\nDo you know what it feels like\nLoving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?\nDo you know what it feels like\nTo be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?\n\nDo you know, do you know\nDo you know, do you know?\n\nDo you know what it feels like\nLoving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?\nDo you know what it feels like\nTo be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?\n\nDo you know what it feels like (You don't know how it feels)\nLoving someone that's in a rush to throw you away? (You don't know how it feels)\nDo you know what it feels like (You don't know how it feels)\nTo be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed? (You don't know how it feels)\n\nDo you know, do you know\nDo you know, do ya...?"}
