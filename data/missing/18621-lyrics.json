(Nights I've laid in bed excited over you)\nOoh... (One hundred different ways I've thought of)\nOoh... (Many, Many...)\nDay and night, night and day\nAll I want to say is\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman,\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, and I won't\nBut, if I was your girl\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman,\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, and I won't\nBut, if I was your girl\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman,\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not..."}
