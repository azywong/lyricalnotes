Come again.\n\nGive me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor, give me champagne\nBubbles till the end\nWhat happens at the leather, if you inspired it till I'm ten\nLike oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again\nAgain and again\n\nWasted so much, irrelevant\nWe're kicked to the head, who's selling it\nI got the hang of it, that's my limousine\nDon't mean like I said, I'm too intelligent\nA little jack can't hurt this veteran\nI show up but I never throw up, so let the drinks go up, go up\n\n(Taio Cruz)\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI've been drinking too much for sure\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI got an empty cup\nPour me some more\n\nSo I can go until they close up, eh\nAnd I can drink until I'm told up, eh\nAnd I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh\nI want to keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!"}
