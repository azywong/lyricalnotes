Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';\nStill the one I need - I will always be with you...\nWhoa! You got me all gone - don't ever let me go;\nSay it real loud if you fly:\n\"If you leave me, you out of your mind!\"\n\nMy baby is a (10);\nWe dressin' to the (9),\nHe pick me up, we (8);\nMake me feel so lucky (7)...\nHe kiss me in his (6);\nWe be makin' love in (5)...\nStill the one I do this (4)\nI'm tryna make a (3) from the (2);\nStill the one.\n\nThere's ups and downs in this love;\nGot a lot to learn in this love...\nThrough the good and the bad, still got love;\nDedicated to the one I love...\n\nI still love the way he talk, he still love the way I sing;\nStill the way he love them black diamonds in that chain...\nStill hot up on each other, ain't a damn thing changed;\nMy girls can't tell me nothin' - I'm gone in the brain...\n\nI'm all up under him like it's cold - wintertime;\nAll up in the kitchen in my heels - dinnertime...\nDo whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind;\nGive it all to him, meet him at the finish line...\n\nMe, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';\nAll up in that black, with his chick right beside him...\nLadies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;\nGrind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...\n\nMe, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';\nAll up in that black, with his chick right beside him...\nLadies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;\nGrind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...\n\nOh! Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';\nStill the one I need - I will always be with you...\nWhoa! You got me all gone - don't ever let me go;\nSay it real loud if you fly:\n\"If you leave me, you out of your mind!\"\n\nMy baby is a (10);\nWe dressin' to the (9),\nHe pick me up, we (8);\nMake me feel so lucky (7)...\nHe kiss me in his (6)\nWe be makin' love in (5)\nStill the one I do this (4)\nI'm tryna make a (3) from the (2);\nStill the one.\n\nIf I put it on him, it ain't nothin' that I can't do;\nYep, I buy my own - if he deserve it, buy his shit too...\nAll up in the sto' - Shawty trickin' if I want to;\nAll up in the sto' - Shawty, fly as we want to...\n\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)\nDamn, I think I love that boy - do anything for that boy;\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...) Boy...\nNow I'll never be the same - it's you and me until the end...\n\nMe, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';\nAll up in that black, with his chick right beside him...\nLadies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;\nGrind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...\n\nMe, and my boo, and my boo lip-lockin';\nAll up in the back, cause the chicks keep blockin'!\nAll that gossipin' - 10 years, stop it!\nLondon, speed it up - Houston, rock it!\n\nOh! Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';\nStill the one I need - I will always be with you...\nWhoa! You got me all gone - don't ever let me go;\nSay it real loud if you fly:\n\"If you leave me, you out of your mind!\"\n\nMy baby is a (10);\nWe dressin' to the (9),\nHe pick me up, we (8);\nMake me feel so lucky (7)...\nHe kiss me in his (6)\nWe be makin' love in (5)\nStill the one I do this (4)\nI'm tryna make a (3) from the (2);\nStill the one."}
