Of falling in love again.\nSo please don't hurt me, I'm scared.\nDon't desert me, I'm afraid.\nOf being a fool. Again.\nSo Baby I'm yours, if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours, if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever, if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours, if you need me. Oh...\nRealize girl that my faith is kind of torn.\nWatch your step girl, Because my heart is weak and worn.\nSo won't you please be careful, I'm fragile.\nI can't imagine the damage,\nI have to handle. If you hurt me one more time,\nPlease be mine.\nSo Baby I'm yours, if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours, if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever, if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours, if you need me. Oh...\nBaby, I've been through a whole lot of relationships,\nWhole lot of broken promises,\nBut now I'm ready for a real one sweet heart.\nYes I am.\nYou don't have to worry baby.\nDon't you every go away.\nBaby I'm, Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm, Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm, Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm, Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm, Baby Baby I'm yours.\nSo Baby I'm yours, if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours, if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever, if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours, if you need me. Oh..."}
