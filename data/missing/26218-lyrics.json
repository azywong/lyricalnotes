(no, n-no)\n\nSo close enough, I want to lock in your love\nI think we're close enough, could I lock in your love, baby?\nI feel we're close enough, I want to lock in your love\nI think we're close enough, could I lock in your love, baby?\n\nNow I've got you in my space, I won't let go of you (no, n-no)\nGot you shackled in my embrace, I'm latching onto you (no, n-no)\nNow I've got you in my space, I won't let go of you (no, n-no)\nGot you shackled in my embrace, I'm latching onto you (no, n-no)\n\nI'm latching onto you (I'm latchin' on)\nI won't let go of you (I won't let go, no, n-no)\nI'm latching onto you (I - won't - let - go)\nI won't let go of you (I won't let go, I won't let go, I won't let go...)"}
