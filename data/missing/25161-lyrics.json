(Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl?\nIs it you, girl? (Ow!)\n\n(Iyaz - Verse 2)\n\nThey say, to get a MIA girl,\nThen you gotta have a lot of swag\nAnd I heard, to get a Down South belle,\nThen you gotta ride a Cadillac\n\nAnd I know, ain't like them London girls,\n'Cause they know how to party. Oh!\nAnd no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know\nThat this song here is about you\n\nSee I done been around the world\nTo places you would not believe\nAnd seeing all those pretty girls\nAnd wishing you were there with me\n\nThe simple way when you smile, girl\nTells me all I need to know\nYou can be my one and only!\n\n(Iyaz - Chorus)\n\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\n\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this town\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna find a shorty to hold me down\n\nTell me is it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Oh!)\n\n(Travie McCoy)\n\nI'm so indecisive\nTryna find a pretty girl that these shoes go nice with\nBeen around the world and back, got a knack for them girls in black\nBut I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips\n\nJust make sure you leave my heart how you found it\nYou can keep the key but the lock stays around it\nBaby, let's take it slow, no pullin' a fast one\nAnd you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one\n\n(Iyaz - Chorus)\n\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\n\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this city (Hey!)\nThere's a lot of pretty girls in this town\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna pick the right one\nTryna find a shorty to hold me down\n\nTell me is it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl? (Hey!)\nIs it you, girl?"}
