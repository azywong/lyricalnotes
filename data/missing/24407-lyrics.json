What are you drinking?\nI think I know what are you thinking.\nBaby, what's your sign? Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.\nSay, what's somebody like you doin' in a place like this?\n\nTimbaland and Katy Perry\n1,2,3,4\n\nKaty Perry\nI'll never be the same\n\nTimbaland\nIf we ever meet again\n\nKaty Perry\nWon't let you get away\n\nTimbaland\nSaid if we ever meet again\n\nTimbaland and Katy Perry\nThis freefall's got me, so\nKiss me all night, don't ever let me go\n\nKaty Perry\nI'll never be the same\n\nTimbaland\nIf we ever meet again\n\nKaty Perry\nDo you come here much?\nI swear I've seen your face before, before\nHope you don't see me blush\nBut I can't help but want you more, more\n\nBaby, tell me what's your story?
