I feel naked,\nI want it, so let me get it,\nYou say you got it, what you gon' do with it?\n\n(Enrique Iglesias)\nIf I told you girl\nCome and run away with me\nNow will you throw it all away for me?\nI need to know that, need to know that\nIt's not over\n\n(Dev)\n'Cause you were the boy\nDaddy told you to stay away from me\nBut you're nothing but a fantasy\nI need to know that, need to know that\nYou'd be strong enough to believe in us\n\n(Both)\n'Cause I don't care what they say\nIt's our life, life, life\nWe can dance if we want\nMake it feel all right\nTemperature's rising\nI feel the fire\nTonight, it's just me and you\n\n(Dev)\nTell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?\nEven with no makeup\nI don't want to fake it\n\n(Enrique Iglesias)\nAnd you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you\nEverytime I'm with you\n\n(Dev)\nI feel naked\nHey! I feel naked,\nI want it, so let me get it,\nYou say you got it, what you gon' do with it?\n\n(Both)\nI don't care what they say\nIt's our life, life, life\nWe can dance if we want\nMake it feel all right\n\nTemperature's rising\nI feel the fire\nTonight, it's just me and you\nTonight, it's just me and you\n\n(Dev)\nSo tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?\n\n(Enrique Iglesias)\nI feel naked\n\n(Dev)\nI feel naked\n\nI want it, so let me get it,\nYou say you got it.\nIt's the Cataracs!\n\nI feel naked,\nI want it, so let me get it,\nYou say you got it, what you gon' do with it?\n\n(Both)\nTonight, it's just me and you"}
