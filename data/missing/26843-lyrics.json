(No!)\nI'm just with my friends online and there's things we'd like to change!\nNext thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane\nFame, what a shame! (Oh!)\nWell, just keep looking, looking, looking!\n\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nIf that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nIf that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)\n\nYou've been reading about yourself on a plane, fame for a change\nCaught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion\nYou've got a beautiful face but got nothing to say (Oh!)\n\"You look famous, let's be friends and portray we possess something important\nAnd do the things we'd like\"\n\n\"We've just come to represent a decline in the standards of what we accept!\"\nYeah...\nYeah...\nYeah?!\nNo!\n\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nIf that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nIf that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)\n\nOh so sack off your calendar, give it to the people!\nBe the man that gets them up on their feet\nSay \"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\"\n\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nAnd love me (Yeah)\nIf that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)"}
