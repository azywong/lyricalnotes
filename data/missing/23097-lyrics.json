I know\nI done put in a call, time to ring the alarm\n'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause\n\nShe gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats\nI let you go\nBitch in the house off the coast\nI let you go\nShe gon' take everything I own\nI let you go\nI can't let you go\nDamn, if I let you go\nShe gon' rock them VVS stones\nI let you go\nIt's in the 'Bach or the Rolls\nI let you go\nShe gon' profit everything I taught\nI let you go\nI can't let you go\nIf I let you go\n\nHow can you look at me\nAnd not see all the things that I kept only just for you?\nWhy would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?\nBut this is my show and I won't let you go\nAll has been paid for, and it's mine\nHow could you look at me\nAnd not see all the things?\n\nShe gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats\nI let you go\nBitch in the house off the coast\nI let you go\nShe gon' take everything I own\nI let you go\nI can't let you go\nDamn, if I let you go\nShe gon' rock them VVS stones\nI let you go\nIt's in the 'Bach or the Rolls\nI let you go\nShe gon' profit everything I taught\nI let you go\nI can't let you go\nDamn, if I let you go."}
