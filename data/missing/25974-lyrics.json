(Then put your hands up...)\n(If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nThen put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)\n\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\n\nSean Don!\nOkay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;\nSpent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...\nGod! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo,\nOn the moon - who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you... (got you...)\nI got you...\n\nBoy, you make me feel so lucky;\nFinally the stars align...\nNever has it been so easy\nTo be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...\n\nYou know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)\nPut it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...\nHow can this be wrong when it feels so right?\nYeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh...\n\nAnd I'll never let you go...\n\nYou should know I'm never gonna change;\nI'm always gonna stay...\nWhen you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)\n'Cause you listen, and you care;\nYou're so different, no one compares,\nAnd if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;\nI'll always be right there...\n\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\n\nI get butterflies just thinking\nAbout you - boy, you're on my mind...\nSometimes I catch myself daydreaming,\nLost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time...\n\nYou know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)\nPut it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...\nHow can this be wrong when it feels so right?\nYeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh...\n\nAnd I'll never let you go...\n\nYou should know I'm never gonna change;\nI'm always gonna stay...\nWhen you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)\n'Cause you listen, and you care;\nYou're so different, no one compares,\nAnd if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;\nI'll always be right there...\n\n(What, okay, what...)\nNow if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?\nIf my Benz turned back to public transportation?\nWould you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting\nAnd get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?\nA player too - you know I had some girls missionary;\nMy black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,\nAnd bible, I got it recycled - I love and I like you.\nFive-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-through,\nThat's why I got you...\n\nAnd I'll never let you go... (I got you.)\n\nYou should know I'm never gonna change; (I'm never gonna change...)\nI'm always gonna stay... (I'm always gonna stay...)\nWhen you call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there...), right there...\n'Cause you listen, and you care;\nYou're so different, no one compares,\nAnd if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;\nI'll always be right there...\n\n(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nYou got it! I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\n(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nI'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\n\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party,)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)\nYou got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)\nGot it, babe..."}
