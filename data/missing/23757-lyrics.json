Yeah, that's my bodyguard\nWear a lot of jewelery Young don't do security\nIt was whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate\nIf you want it come and get it\nYou know I stay super straight\nRan up in my spots and now I'm workin' at the Super 8\nKnow you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate\nY'all sing Happy Birthday, yeah I got that super cake\nHundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait\nI put on for my city, on on for my city\nI put on for my city, on on for my city\nPut on (east side)\nPut on (south side)\nPut on (west side)\nPut on (x2)\n\nHalf bag, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug\nHKs, AKs, I need to join a gun club\nBig wheels, big straps, you know I like it super sized\nPassenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries\nInside's fish sticks, outside tartar sauce\nPocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me\nBlowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked\nRidin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote\nThey know I got that broccoli, so I keep that glock on me\nDon't get caught without one, comin' from where I'm from\nCall me Jeezy Hamilton, flyin' down Campbellton\nSo fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene\n\n(Kanye)\nI put on... (x3)\nI put on for my city, I put on for my\nI put on for my city, I put on for my city\nOn\n\nI feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks\nI feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex\nI feel like this but niggas don't know the stress\nI lost the only girl in the world that know me best\nI got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit\nI got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit\n'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace\nYo, I need just at least one of Russell's nieces\nOn... I let my nightmares go\nI put on, everybody that I knew from the go\nI know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke\nThey say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more\nYou got that big fame homie, and you just changed homie\nYou can ask big homie, man the top sure lonely I ain't lyin'\nSo lonely I ain't lyin'\nLet me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)\nI'm high as a satellite (satellite)\nI see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)\n'Cause every night every night\nI put on\n\nLet me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)\nI'm high as a satellite (satellite)\nI see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)\n'Cause every night every night\nLet me see what we have tonight\nI'm high as a satellite\nI see those flashin' lights"}
