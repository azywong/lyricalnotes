Tell me, baby\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me\nAnd call me baby?\n\nYou said you want my love\nAnd you've got to have it all\nBut first, there are some things you need to know\nIf you wanna live\nWith all I have to give\nI need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah\n\nI don't want you\nTrying to get with me\nAnd I end up unhappy\nI don't need the hurt\nAnd I don't need the pain\n\nSo before I do\nGive myself to you\nI have to know the truth\nIf I spend my life with you\n\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nWhat would you do babe, tell me right now\n\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me\nAnd call me baby?\nDon't you lie to me\n\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me (comfort me)\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me\nAnd call me baby?\nDon't you dare lie to me, baby\n\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me\nAnd call me baby\n\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me\nWhat would you do if I gave it to you?\n\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me\nAnd call me baby"}
