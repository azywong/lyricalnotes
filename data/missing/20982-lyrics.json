(How?)\n\nOh\n\nIt's a private emotion that fills you tonight\nAnd a silence falls between us\nAs the shadows steal the light\nAnd wherever you may find it\nWherever it may lead\nLet your private emotion come to me\n\nCome to me, come to me\n\nEvery endless night has a dawning day\nEvery darkest sky has a shining ray\nIt takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by\nBut you can find me here 'til your tears run dry\n\nIt's a private emotion that fills you tonight\nAnd a silence falls between us\nAs the shadows steal the light\nAnd wherever you may find it\nWherever it may lead\nLet your private emotion come to me\n\nLet your private emotion come to me\nLet your private emotion come to me\n\nCome to me, come to me"}
