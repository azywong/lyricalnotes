Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street I hear\n\"Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk\"\n\nKendrick Lamar:\nMan down, where you from, nigga?\nFuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?\nWhere your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga\n\nBrace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane\nThis is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine\nThis is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain\nNot the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain\nIt was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans\nIt got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh\nWarriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance\nWith society, the driver seat the first one to get killed\nSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out\nAt the same burger stand where hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was looking at him different\nThat was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine\nPakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime\nPack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?\nFuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?\nPicking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers\nSuck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from\nAK's, AR's, \"Aye y'all, duck\"\nThat's what mama said when we was eating the free lunch\nAw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose\nYou killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce\nNow crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news\nAin't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve\nBodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's\nObviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys\nWhen you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct\nMake sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect\nThey say the governor collect, all of our taxes except\nWhen we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat\nYou moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec\nGo buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city\n\nMan down, where you from, nigga?\nFuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?\nWhere your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga\n\nKendrick Lamar and Schoolboy Q:\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street I hear\n\"Yawk, yawk, yawk\"\n\nMC Eiht:\nWake your punk ass up\nIt ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah\nReal simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street\nIt ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah\nHow we do?\n\nKendrick Lamar:\nFresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad\nSleeping in the living room in my mama's pad\nReality struck I seen the white car crash\nHit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed\nMy pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him\nSecurity guard for a month and ended up leaving\nIn fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends\nTo stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in\nProjects tore up, gang signs get thrown up\nCocaine laced in marijuana\nAnd they wonder why I rarely smoke now\nImagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth\nI was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even\nI made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding\nYou know the reasons but still won't ever know my life\nKendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice\n\nMC Eiht:\nG-yeah\nCocaine, weed\nNiggas been mixing shit since the eighties, loc\nSherm sticks, butt nakeds\nDip, make a nigga flip\nCluck heads all up and down the block and shit\nOne time's crooked and shit\nBlock a nigga in\nAlondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton\n\nI'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool\nThe hood took me under so I follow the rules\nBut yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang\nAnd niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang\nPass it to the left so I can smoke on me\nA couple drive-by's in the hood lately\nCouple of IV's with the fucking spray can\nShots in the crowd then everybody ran\nCrew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave\nShots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave\nMount up, regulators in the whip\nDown the boulevard with the pistol grip\nTrip, we in the hood still\nSo loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real\nDeal with the outcome, a strap in the hand\nAnd a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand\n\nKendrick Lamar:\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?\nOr see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper\nThat hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip\nThe Children of the Corn, they vandalizing\nThe option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins\nConstantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame\nThat arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim\nAnd they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits\nA price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects\nI live inside the belly of the rough\nCompton, USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what\n\nM.A.A.d city\nCompton\n\nNigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn\nYou ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for?\nNiggas always acting unsensitive and shit\n(Nigga, that ain't no word)\nNigga, shut up\nHey, Dot, you good, my nigga?\nDon't even trip, just lay back and drink that"}
