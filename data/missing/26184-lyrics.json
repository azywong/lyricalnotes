Everyone's talking\nLife is good 'cause everything's awesome\nLost my job, it's a new opportunity\nMore free time for my awesome community\n\nI feel more awesome than an awesome opossum\nDipped my body in chocolate frostin'\nThree years later, washed out the frostin'\nSmellin' like a blossom, everything is awesome\nStepped in mud, got new brown shoes\nIt's awesome to win, and it's awesome to lose (it's awesome to lose)\n\nEverything is better when we stick together\nSide by side, you and I, gonna win forever, let's party forever\nWe're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all working in harmony\n\nEverything is awesome\nEverything is cool when you're part of a team\nEverything is awesome, when we're living our dream\n\nBlue skies, bouncy springs\nWe just named two awesome things\nA Nobel prize, a piece of string\nYou know what's awesome? Everything\n\nDogs with fleas, allergies, a book of Greek antiquities\nBrand new pants, a very old vest\nAwesome items are the best\n\nTrees, frogs, clogs\nThey're awesome\nRocks, clocks, and socks\nThey're awesome\nFigs, and jigs, and twigs\nThat's awesome\nEverything you see, or think, or say\nIs awesome\n\nEverything is awesome\nEverything is cool when you're part of a team\nEverything is awesome, when we're living our dream"}
