Butterfly is in the treetop\nBirds that blow the meaning into bebop\n\nThe world I love, the tears I've dropped\nTo be part of the wave can't stop\nEver wonder if it's all for you?\nThe world I love, the trains I hop\nTo be part of the wave can't stop\nCome and tell me when it's time to\n\nWait a minute, I'm passing out, win or lose\nJust like you\nFar more shocking than anything I ever knew\nHow about you?\n\nTen more reasons why I need somebody new\nJust like you\nFar more shocking than anything I ever knew\nRight on cue\n\nCan't stop, addicted to the shindig\nChop top, he says I'm gonna win big\nChoose not, a life of imitation\nDistant cousin to the reservation\n\nDefunct, the pistol that you pay for\nThis punk, the feeling that you stay for\nIn time I want to be your best friend\nEastside love is living on the West End\n\nKnocked out but boy you better come to\nDon't die, you know, the truth is, some do\nGo write your message on the pavement\nBurn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant\n\nKick start the golden generator\nSweet talk but don't intimidate her\nCan't stop the gods from engineering\nFeel no need for any interfering\n\nYour image in the dictionary\nThis life is more than ordinary\nCan I get two, maybe even three, of these?\nComing from space to teach you of the Pleiades\n\nCan't stop the spirits when they need you\nThis life is more than just a read through"}
