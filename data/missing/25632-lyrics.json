'Cause I do anything you like\nI make her freeze up, pick her knees up\nShe want a made nigga, watch me clean up\nI know where to put it: I put it in her life\nI leave that pussy smoking, smoking like ice\n\n(Kelly Rowland)\nYou're like ice, I-C-E\nFeels so nice, scorching me\nYou're so hot\nBaby, your love is so hot\n\nYou put the pillow (right there) underneath my back\nGot me up against the window (right now)\nWe ain't got no shame\nWe goin' in\nHe hates it when I use my hands\nGot me sayin' like \"damn, my man knows what he's doin'\"\nThe mirrors up on the ceiling got things so visual\nBabe, I ain't never felt so right\nHe comes again\nMy body goin' numb\nHot as ice, can't get enough\n\nYou're like ice, I-C-E\nFeels so nice, scorching me\nYou're so hot\nBaby, your love is so hot\n\nYou're like ice"}
