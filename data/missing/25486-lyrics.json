It's real simple.\nLittle bit of vole, and she'll open sesame...\n\nNow dance, yes;\nLove, next.\nDance, yes;\nLove, next.\n\nIf this would be a perfect world, we'd be together then;\n(Let's do it, do it, do it...)\nOnly got just one life, this I've learned - Who cares what they're gonna say?\n(Let's do it, do it, do it...)\n\nI wanna dance, and love, and dance again...\nI wanna dance, and love, and dance again..."}
