Does it burn?\nIs it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?\nDoes it thrill? Does it sting?\nWhen you feel what I bring and you wish that you had me to hold\n\nWhen it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love\nYou'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams\n\nSay, is there anyone out there?\n'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe\nIs there anyone out there?\n'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe\nIs there anyone out there?\n'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe"}
