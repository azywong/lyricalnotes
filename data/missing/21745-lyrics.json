My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\n\nSometimes you can be in love and having fun\nAnd still not know what's goin' on\nOr on the other hand you separate, thinking that the feelin's gone\nFeels like forever when we're together\nI knew that we are destinied\nSo here's the last chance for the last dance\nFor us to bring back the dream\n\nSo baby come and rescue me\nI'm burnin up!\nI got some fire for you to see\nI'm burnin up!\nBaby come and take me there\nI'm burnin up!\nTrust me you should\nHurry up!\nBaby I'm just burnin up!\nI'm burnin up!\n\nRap:\n\nIn the midnight\nWait a minute\nI can be in a lonely place\nThen along you come with the sweetest thing to say\nAnd put the sun in my day\n\nSo baby come and rescue me\nI'm burnin up!\nI got some fire for you to see\nI'm burnin up!\nBaby come and take me there\nI'm burnin up!\nTrust me you should\nHurry up!\nBaby I'm just burnin up!\nI'm burnin up!\n\nSo baby come and rescue me\nI'm burnin up!\nI got some fire for you to see\nI'm burnin up!\nBaby come and take me there\nI'm burnin up!\nTrust me you should\nHurry up!\nBaby I'm just burnin up!\nI'm burnin up!\n\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!\nBurning up! My heart is like burnin up!"}
