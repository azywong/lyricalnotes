All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard \n\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\nI drowned out all my sense with the sounds of its beating\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\n\nPain, make your way to me, to me\nAnd I'll always be just so, so inviting\nIf I ever start to think straight\nThis heart will start a riot in me, let's start, start, hey!\n\nWhy do we like to hurt so much?\nOh, why do we like to hurt so much?\n\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa\nNow I can't trust myself with anything but this\nAnd that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa"}
