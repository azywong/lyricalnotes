America the Beautiful\nHuh, yeah, let me introduce y'all... to the Wildside\n\nAnnie was a high school cheerleader\nPom poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter\nCome Prom time everybody was on the line\nAll the fellas swinging nickel and dime\nTales about love and lust and trust\nBut Annie took it all in stride\n'Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations\nWanted to be a chemical engineer\nMaking fifty to fifty-five thousand a year\nHer first year of college was a success\nBut along came Billy possessed and obsessed\nHe took Annie on a fatal date\nAnd showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate\nAnnie took a hit breathed two short breaths\nOne for life... the last for death\nNow she's gone, a former Valedictorian\nEnded up becoming a topic for historians\nWashed up dreams and shattered pride\nAll because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside\n\nRon had enough of being broke everyday\nSaying to himself, there's gotta be a better way\n'Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches\nSo Ron figured out a faster way to make - money\nBefore you know it, he's a rich man\nGold on every finger of his hand\nA brand new BMW, a condo, Ron ended up a John Doe\nA body was found in the alley but never claimed\nFull of bullet holes but none to blame\nRon became another victim of homicide\nBecause he chose to walk - on the Wildside\n\nCharles had everything going for him\nA top paying job, a good life, a good wife\nA baby boy on the way any day\nA gentleman attitude is all he displayed\nCarol was the wife he loved and adored\nHer family and friends treated him like an Ambassador\nOne night on the other side of town\nA police dispatcher picked up a weird sound\nCharles on the car phone asking for help\nClaiming a burglar shot his wife and himself\nHis pregnant wife lay slumped over\nDreams corrupted and a young life over\nExtensive searches throughout the projects\nPut a lot of people through misery and wreck\nEveryone a suspect till someone was found\nInterrogated 'cause their skin was brown\nThen there was Bennett, guilty until proven so\nBut soon as the case started moving slow\nWhat do you know, sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed\nCharles was the culprit\nThe whole plot was an insurance scam\nCharles and his brother came up with a plan\nKill Carol, collect a big check\nBlame it on a black man, what the heck?\nAnd just before the story was known\nCharles had a feeling that his cover was blown\nSo he jumped off a bridge\nCommitted suicide\nThis is how it is - on the Wildside\n\nLittle Tiffany, only thirteen\nCame to the city, place of big dreams\nVisiting family and friends for the summertime\nSittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees\nAnd the girls play hopscotch\nSo far, her vacation was top notch\nThen out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed\nGang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede\nQuick as a blink shots rang out loud\nAnd a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd\nOne hit Tiffany, and instantly she died\nInnocently - on the Wildside"}
