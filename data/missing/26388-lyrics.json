Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it\nAnd I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it\nAnd I hold it down\nStarted from the bed, ended up the on the floor\nAnd now let that ass up off the ground\nI'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store\nGirl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'\nAway from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away\nAnd I hold you down, (I'mma hold you down) I'mma hold you down baby\n\nI'm the one gone hold you down\nPut you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town\nEven when the roads is down\nYou mesmerized by the flying sky\nWe gotta socialize and cherished times\nThis shit is deeper than love\nI pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky\nShit is straight up suicide\nYou in that new Bentley truck\nNew, new Bentley truck\nOh, oh, oh, ooh\nWe've been playing in that Versace\nWe go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby\nYour body my new Bugatti\n\nLive an expensive life and I'm just getting started\nI get instant hype 'cause you forever my lady\nForever my baby (real life)\nHold you down, hold you down\nGirl you helped me up when I was down\nIn and out, girl\nHold you down like I'm supposed to\nReal nigga, I know you, real nigga, I know you"}
