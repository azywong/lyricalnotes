(Yeah)\n\nLudacris:\nI'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of my time\n'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm outta my mind\nAnd you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice\nSo I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy\n\nLudacris and Usher:\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life"}
