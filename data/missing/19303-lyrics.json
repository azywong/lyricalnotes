I been thinkin' 'bout you all day\nYeah!\nWell I just wanna talk to you for a minute you know what I'm sayin'\nSo um meet me in the park you know what I'm sayin' over there by the swings, yeah over there\nCheck this out!\n\nGirl if I could tell you how much I love you it hurts inside\nUntil you wake me out of my sleep\nYou bring me joy from all this pain some how the feelings all the same I don't care how old we are cause love don't have no limit no\nThese 3 words I sing to you let them show my gratitude for hangign out with me tonight\nI promise you love and no harm come let me hold you in my arms as long as I am standing here there's no need for you to fear no more\n\nLet me be your fire (let me be your fire)\n'Cause you're my one desire (you are my desire)\nIf you kiss me I won't tell (I won't tell)\nJust meet me by the swings in the park after dark yeah!\n\nI always ask my self the same questions each and everyday\nWhy am I so blessed to have you (to have you yeah)\nThen I realize it's that look in your eyes that always take me by surprise don't wanna spend my whole life through growing up and missing you Oh\n\nLet me be your fire (let me be your fire)\n'Cause you're my one desire (you are my desire)\nIf you kiss me I won't tell (If you kiss me baby I won't)\nJust meet me by the swings in the park after dark"}
