If we try together.\n\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand).\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice).\nMaybe we could change things.\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart).\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark).\nMaybe we could change things somehow"}
