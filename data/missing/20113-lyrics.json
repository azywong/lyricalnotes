Quick\nHoney smoke make you click, feel it in their throats\nNo joke all this love, let it stay broke out\nBehind every playa is a true playette\nBounce you up, outta there, push and check\nTaster's choice, have you nice and moist\nOr play paper games or floss the rolls royce\n\nSomething like a phenomenon (repeat 8X)\n(Uh huh) (go ahead daddy)\n\nHe was king of seduction, cop a suction\nNow she was the cat that worked construction\nStarve her with the paper, abuse the mind\nDis a new lover, when you know it's on mine\nThat's on top, lap dancin got to stop\nYou play out your chick cause your game is hot\nI give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew\nHe's banging on my chest till it's black and blue\nYou beefin, yellin' on the cell of my 6\nYou reach it then you hear the cordless click\nNow your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'\nUse my chips and take the next man shoppin'\nHell no, must be out Chicago\nOn your knees and your elbows each and every time\nThat's why I love you mami, you\nRun your mouth though your legs over the bed baby\nWork me out\n\nSomething like a phenomenon (repeat 8X)\n(Uh huh) (go ahead daddy)\n\nHe was all souped up, but played it just right\nMami I was full blown, my game was air tight\nI needed to switch up and get it in gear\nIt's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah\nKeep it jinglin, no more minglin\nA brand new year, me and you can bring it in\nI'm sick and tired of the freakin, night to morn'\nMoanin in the mirror with my cubans on\nLet bygones be bygones, no more games\nHope all the chickenheads go up in flames\nNow we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back\nGot it all figured out, mami I like that\nCollect tips, cop his and her whips\nThe voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe\nBut you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field\nSay what you want, but keep your lips sealed\n\nSomething like a phenomenon (repeat 8X)\n(Uh huh) (go ahead daddy)"}
