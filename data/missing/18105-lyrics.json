I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\n\nWhen I walked in the gym your man was talkin'\nLickin' his lips while I was walkin'\nHe called my name to make me smile\nCause his buds were in the gym and I'm walkin' with style\nSo he grabbed my by the arm and pulled me to the side\nSaid he'd be mine till the day I die\nHe told me he'd love me till the very end\nHey girl! I got your boyfriend!\n\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\n\nWhen I first saw your man, he was really fine, he had a natural shake, it was so devine, he had a red mercedes benz that was drop down low, gold pin stripe it was good to go, it had a gucci rad top, with a system that thumped 30 foot ___ w/ a boom in the trunk, he kissed me on the cheek, and you know that's all he got, now he calls me everyday saying \"I like you a lot\"\n\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\n\nOh gurl you know I love ya\nOh gurl you know I love ya\nOh gurl you know I love ya\nOh gurl you know I love ya\n\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\n\nIf you got a boyfreidn, you better hold on tight, and keep him in sight every single night, 'cause when I got out, I look so fine, 'cause I'm dressed to impress, and I'm one of a kind, I take him, shake him, work him on out, show your man what I'm all about, so when he tells you it's the end, that's when you know I got your boyfriend\n\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man\nBoom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man"}
