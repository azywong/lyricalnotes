She looked kinda all alone.\nSo I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.\nI showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.\nShe knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said \"How much money you make?\"\n\nJerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.\nJerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.\n\nI took her to my crib and I tied her up. I figured that's what she liked.\nMaybe I was wrong but what the hell, it didn't matter to me. - She was white.\nI said \"How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?\nAin't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!\"\n\nIt just pisses you off to see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?\nBet you'd rather see me drivin' one of those ester grate ones.\nLike the one your daddy drives, wouldn't you?\nLet me tell you one thing. That's dead!\nAbout as dead as you'll be if you don't rearrange your brain.\nCatch my drift. Turn it up!\n\nOh, nasty me!\n\nGirl, you think you wanna turn it up? Where's my checkbook?\nThat's right, check it out. An awful lot of O's, wouldn't you say?\n\nHit it. Cross over, uh!\nTurn it up.\n\nJerk out, jerkin' everything in sight.\nJerk out, got to make some love tonight.\n\nJerk out.\nDon't cha all just hate it, when we walk into y'all's joint?\nAnd just jerk out everything in sight?\nDon't it make you mad?\nJerk out - Don't it make you mad?\nJerk out - It'd make me mad!\n\nEverybody in the house say \"Jerk out\" - Jerk out!\n\"Ow!\" - Ow!\nSay \"Jerk out\" - Jerk out!\n\"Ow!\" - Ow!\nEverybody say \"Jerk out\" - Jerk out!\n\"Ow!\" - Ow!\nEverybody say \"Jerk out\" - Jerk out!\n\"Ow!\" - Ow!\n\nPeople, let me turn it up. Which coat should I wear tonight?\nIf you think I'm vain, you're right.\nLook out, somebody say \"Vanity\" - Vanity!\n\"Jerk out\" - Jerk out!\n\"Ow!\" - Ow!\n\nEverybody jerk out and do it right.\nI'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out.\nOh Lawd, hey yeah. Got to make some love to night.\nI'm master of the jerk out, oh Lawd. Jerkin' everything in sight.\nI'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, oh Lawd. Got to make some love tonight.\n\nTurn it up, uh! Jerk out, oh yeah! Jerkin' everything in sight.\nWait a minute, talkin' 'bout the jerk out. Jerkin' everything in sight.\nJerk out. Jerkin' everything in sight.\nI'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, oh Lawd. Got to make...\nI got to make a little love tonight.\nJerk out!"}
