BK.B... uh... K... they say you can't have ur cake and eat it too...\nTell me wats the meaning...\nWats the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it\nCheaters never win, my friend, u like creepin'\nBut hate when ure girl starts cheatin'\nImagine if you came home to ur wife,\nOpened ur door and locked it,\nThen you found rkelly hiding in ur closet\nI knew you would start cheatin', before you even stopped it\nI'm like when you double ur money, I'm a profit...\nAlbert einstein was smart, but I'm sum wiser...\nI'm a ladies man, ur man is a womanizer\nU gotta fite for love, can you make a fist\nSince ur name is genie, can I make a wish? (yeah)\nNo minor set backs, every move major\nGrown folk behaviour, jus do me one favour...\nHe put you on the side, let me be ur saviour...\nCrowded...\nPapoose\nJeannie ortega\n\n(Chorus: Jeannie Ortega)\n\nI dunno wat you been thinkin' 'bout me\nDid you think this was gonna be that easy?\nHell no, u must be going crazy!\n(No-o-ooh) Why don't you get outta my life,\nGet outta my sight,\nGet off oh my back...\n\nWhy don't you go back to ur world...\nGo back to ur girl...\nI think you owe her...\n\nI know wats going on\nI won't be second to none (oh no)\n\nBack up, 'cause you crowdin my space...\nU need to get outta my face?\n\nGet outta my life,\nGet outta my sight,\nGet off oh my back...\n\n'Cause ure crowin my space?\nU need to get outta my face?."}
