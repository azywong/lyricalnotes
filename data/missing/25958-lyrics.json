Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)\nI love you more than anything, but the words can't even touch what's in my heart...\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) No, no... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)\n\nWhen I try to explain it, I'd be sounding insane;\nThe words don't ever some out right...\nI get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)\nAnd I say, \"Baby, baby...\" (Whoa, whoa...) \"Baby...\"\n\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...\nAll I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,\n(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)\nBaby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)\n\nBaby, I'm so down for you, no matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around;\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby...\nSee, baby, I've been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about...\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)\n\nWhen I try to explain it, I'd be sounding all crazy;\nWords don't ever come out right...\nI get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)\nAnd I say, \"Baby, baby...\" (Whoa, whoa...) \"Baby...\"\n\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...\nAll I'm tryna say is you're my everything, (baby,)\n(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)\nBaby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)\n\nStraight up, you got me all in, how could I not be? I sure hope you know... (I sure hope you know...)\nIf it's even possible, I love you more\nThan the word \"love\" can say it - it's better not explaining,\nThat's why I keep saying \"Baby, I...\"\n\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...\n(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...\nAll I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,\n(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)\nBaby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...) Baby... (Baby, baby...)\n\n(Baby I!) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...\n(Baby I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...\nAll I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,\n(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)\n(Every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)\nEvery time I try to say it, words can only complicate it...\nBaby, baby... (Whoa, whoa...) Baby, baby..."}
