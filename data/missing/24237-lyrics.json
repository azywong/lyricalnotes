That's how\nIt seems, I close my eyes and\nBreath in the sweetes moments\nI've ever known\nIt feels like home, and here\nI am I wanna be your everything\nThere you are turning winter\nInto spring.\n\nAnd everyone that sees you\nAlways wants to know you\nAnd everyone that knows you\nAlways has a smile\nYour standing ovation\nAfter years of waiting\nFor a chance to finally Shine.\nEveryone calls you amazing\nYeah-eh\nI Just call you mine\n\nI fall apart, just a word from you\nSome how seems to fix, whatever's\nWrong oh\nYou reach into the weakest\nMoments and remind me that I'm\nStrong\nYou've gotta know\n\nI'd be a fool, not to see your\nEven worse\nTo forget that your more than\nI deserve\n\nCause everyone that sees you\nAlways wants to know you\nAnd everyone that knows you\nAlways has a smile\nYour standing ovation\nAfter years of waiting\nFor a chance to finally Shine.\nEveryone calls you amazing\nI Just call you mine\n\nNothin' makes sense\nWhen you're not here\nAs if my world disappears\nWithout you what's the point\nOf it\n\nCause everyone that sees you\nAlways wants to know you\nAnd everyone that knows you\nAlways has a smile\nYour the dream that I've been\nChasin'\nAfter years of waiting\nFor a chance to finally Shine.\nEveryone calls you amazing\nI Just call you mine\nEveryone calls you amazing\nYeah yeah yeah\nI just call you mine"}
