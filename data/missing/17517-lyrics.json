Ooh ooh\nDidn't we, girls? Ah, ah\n\nWell I guess it's a brand new day after all\nEvery time we hear the curtain call\nSee the girls with the curls in their hair\nThe buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares\n\nTonight, tonight\n\nRemember when we traveled 'round the world\nWe met a lot of people and girls...\nFan mail from everywhere\nShowed us how you care\n\nDidn't it, girls? Ooh, ooh\nDidn't it, girls? Ah, ah\n\nWell, I guess it's a brand new day after all\nEvery time we hear the curtain call\nSee the girls with the curls in their hair\nThe buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares\n\nTonight, tonight\nTonight, tonight\nTonight, tonight\nTonight, tonight\n\nSounds good\nHey fellas, let's do it\nHere we go\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight\n\nTonight, tonight\nTonight, tonight, all right\n\nTonight, tonight\nTonight, tonight, It's time to take it home now\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight\nLa, la, la, la, la, la tonight"}
