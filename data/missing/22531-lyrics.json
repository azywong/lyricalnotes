And in what month?\nThis clock never seemed so alive\nI can't keep up and I can't back down\nI've been losing so much time\n\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to lose\nAnd it's you and me and all of the people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\nAll of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right\nI'm tripping on words\nYou've got my head spinning \nI don't know where to go from here\n\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to prove\nAnd it's you and me and all of the people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\nThere's something about you now\nI can't quite figure out\nEverything she does is beautiful\nEverything she does is right\n\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to lose\nAnd it's you and me and all of the people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\nAnd me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to prove\nAnd it's you and me and all of the people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\nWhat day is it? And in what month?\nThis clock never seemed so alive"}
