Tell me what I'm gone do\nSince everything I'm trying to forget is all true\nMe and all your main girls get along too\nI would take my last dollar out and bet it on you\nBut ah, you see the same one I'm missing\nIs basically the reason I became something different\nAnd just that I remember me before\nAnd if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure\n\nLoving you no more\nI just I can't I just can't be loving you no more\nI love you more than I love myself\nLoving you no more\nI just I can't I just can't be loving you no more\nI love you more than I love myself"}
