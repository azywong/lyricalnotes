I'm just asking\nWhat's the pattern to the madness?\nEverybody ain't a number one draft pick\nMost of us ain't Hollywood actors\n\nBut if it's all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all can ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nSincerely yours, from one of yours\n\n(Taylor Swift)\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us\n\n(B.o.B)\nI can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle\nYou just wanna live, but everything's so low\nThat you could drown in a puddle\nThat's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up\nFor all the times no one's ever spoke for us\n\nTo every single time that they play this song\nYou can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us\nWhen the tides get too high\nAnd the sea up underneath get so deep\nAnd you feel like you're just another person\n\nGetting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds\nUh, because we won't be near yet, both of us\nBut we still stand tall with our shoulders up\nAnd even though we always against the odds\n\nThese are the things that've molded us\nAnd if life hadn't chosen us\nSometimes I wonder where woulda wind up\n'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint\nThen build it from the ground up, hey\n\nBut if it's all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all can ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nFrom Bobby Ray, to all of y'all\n\n(Taylor Swift)\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us"}
