What do I stand for?\nMost nights, I don't know anymore\n\nOh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh\nOh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh\n\nThis is it, boys, this is war\nWhat are we waiting for?\nWhy don't we break the rules already?\n\nI was never one to believe the hype\nSave that for the black and white\nI try twice as hard and I'm half as liked\nBut here they come again to jack my style\n\nAnd that's alright\nI found a martyr in my bed tonight\nShe stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am\nOh, who am I? mmm, mmm\n\nWell, some nights, I wish that this all would end\n'Cause I could use some friends for a change\nAnd some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again\nSome nights, I always win, I always win\n\nBut I still wake up, I still see your ghost\nOh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh\nWhat do I stand for? What do I stand for?\nMost nights, I don't know (come on)\n\nSo this is it? I sold my soul for this?\nWashed my hands of that for this?\nI miss my mom and dad for this?\n\nNo. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are\nWhen I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on\nOh, come on\nOh, come on\nOh, come on\n\nWell, this is it guys, that is all\nFive minutes in and I'm bored again\nTen years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands\n\nThis one is not for the folks at home\nSorry to leave, mom, I had to go\nWho the fuck wants to die alone\nAll dried up in the desert sun?\n\nMy heart is breaking for my sister\nAnd the con that she call \"love\"\nBut when I look into my nephew's eyes\nMan, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from\n\nSome terrible nights\nAhh, ahh\nAhh, ahh\n\nOh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh\nOh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh\n\nThe other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me\nI called you up, but we'd both agree\n\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance, oh\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance, oh"}
