Oh yeah\nShe was up tonight to get down\nBut she don't wanna be part of the crowd\nWouldn't that be weird? Oh yeah\n\nI'm so confused\nIf you only knew\nShe came to to give it to you\n\nGirl it ain't what you do\nIt's what you do tonight\nAnd there ain't no shortcuts\nIn doing something right\n\nIf you knew what I knew\nShe'd be yours tonight\nJust look around the club\n'Cause you're here to have a good time\n\nSo many benefits to being wild\nJust be cool, enjoy the ride\n'Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah\nDon't be stingy with it, pass the J, when I hit it this headache go away\nYeah that's weird\n\nI'm so confused\nIf you only knew\nShe came to to give it to you\n\nGirl it ain't what you do\nIt's what you do tonight\nAnd there ain't no shortcuts\nIn doing something right\n\nIf you knew what I knew\nShe'd be yours tonight\nJust look around the club\n'Cause you're here to have a good time\n\nNicki Minaj\nYo\nHe want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl\nYou the one who get the worm it's the early bird flow\nSlicker than MJ, early curl\nI got to clip these bitches like sterly sturl\n\nI seen him in the club he could get the cub\nI ain't talking about baseball g-g-get the club\nDon't be like OJ and forget your glove\nTryna get faded, go and get the drug\n\nF-f-five plus five what they call that?
