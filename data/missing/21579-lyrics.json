(What about)\nWhat about us, us? (What about)\nWhat about us? (What about)\nWhat about us, us? (What about us?)\n\nBaby, check it out hear this\nNow what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with\nNow what if I told you the game we play, I picked it\nNow what if I said it wasn't true, so do you\nYou and I know without me there's no you\n\nSo what about bills that were past due, paid for you\nAll you say to me is: \"Baby, I owe you\" (Aha)\nForget about the brand new life that I gave you\nDon't what about us to me 'cause we are through\n\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the nights that you gave?\nWhat about all of the things you told me\n\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the nights that you gave?\nWhat about, what about\n\nWhat about us?\n\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the nights that you gave?\nWhat about all of the things you told me\n\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the nights that you gave?\nWhat about, what about\n\nWhat about us? (What about)\nWhat about us, us? (What about)\nWhat about us? (What about)\nWhat about us, us? (What about us?)"}
