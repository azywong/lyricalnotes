(Don't worry 'bout it)\nSo when they talk about (they talk about it)\nJust let 'em know we already got it\nJust tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)\n\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nDon't listen to (How could they know)\nWhat people say (How could they know)\nThey don't know about (How could they know)\n'Bout you and me (How could they know)\n\nAt my best you love me\nThey don't know about us, they don't know about it\nEven though I act my worse\nThey don't know about us, they don't know about it\nAnd I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends\nWe connected\nThey don't know about us, they don't know about it\n\nWhat did I do to deserve you\nThey don't know about us, they don't know about it\nThey gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)\nGon' try to change your mind about it\nGon' tell you things you don't wanna hear\n'Cause we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)\nSo when they talk about (they talk about it)\nJust let 'em know we already got it\nJust tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)\n\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nDon't listen to (How could they know)\nWhat people say (How could they know)\nThey don't know about (How could they know)\n'Bout you and me (How could they know)\n\nHow could they know\nHow could they know\nHow could they know\nHow could they know\nHow could they know\nThank you for the autographs\nAnd the tears over the years\nYou still found me, you didn't doubt me\nI think you want some more\nI do more than sing\nI'm older now\nActin' now\n'Cause I got my own movie now\nAfter all the awards\nThat they gave me\nYou still found me\nYou didn't play me, you didn't doubt me\nThink you want some more\nI truly believe that if it wasn't all for you\nI don't know what I would do\n\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nI don't think they know the truth\nSay they saw\nI don't think they know, how could they know\nDon't listen to (How could they know)\nWhat people say (How could they know)\nThey don't know about (How could they know)\n'Bout you and me (How could they know)"}
