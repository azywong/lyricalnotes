Show 'em what?) what's really crazy\nYou should've known better than to mess with me, honey (It's all over with now)\nI'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya\nLike a black widow, baby\n\n(Black-black widow, baby)\n\nIggy Azalea:\nI'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts\nJust to get you, I'm doing whatever works\nYou have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya\nThat will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah\nI'ma make you beg for it, plead for it\nTill you feel like you breathe for it\nTill you do any and everything for it\nI want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it\nTill it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it\nTill they have a cat scan that check on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it, on it...)\nNow it's me time believe that\nIf it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that\nTill I'm everywhere that you be at\nI can't fall back, or quit it\n'Cause this here's a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh\n\nRita Ora (Iggy Azalea):\nYou used to be thirsty for me (Right)\nBut now you wanna be set free\nThis is the web, web that you weave\nSo baby now rest in peace\n\n(It's all over with now)\n\nI'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)\nAnd I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what? Show 'em what?) what's really crazy\nYou should've known better than to mess with me, honey\nI'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya\nLike a black widow, baby\n\n(Bla-bla-black, black widow, baby)"}
