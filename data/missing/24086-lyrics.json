I'm in\n\nBaby come on in the water's fine\nI'll be right here you take your time\nJust let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith\nIt's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way\n\nIf I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now\nI would be the best damn poet \nSilver words out of my mouth\nWell my words might not be magic\nBut they cut straight to the truth \nSo if you need a lover and a friend\nBaby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in\n\nBaby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be\nI'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am\n\nIf I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now\nI would be the best damn poet silver words out of my mouth\nWell my words might not be magic\nBut they cut straight to the truth \nNow if you need a lover and a friend\nNow if you need a lover and a friend\nBaby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in\n\nBaby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be\nI'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am\nBaby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be\nBaby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be\nBaby come here baby come here baby come here"}
