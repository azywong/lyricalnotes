Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there\nWhat does he care?\n\nAll the lonely people\nWhere do they all come from?\nAll the lonely people\nWhere do they all belong?\n\nAh, look at all the lonely people\nAh, look at all the lonely people\n\nEleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name\nNobody came\nFather McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave\nNo one was saved\n\nAll the lonely people\nWhere do they all come from?\nAll the lonely people\nWhere do they all belong?"}
