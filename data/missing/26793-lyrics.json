So what can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already\nWe make our own sense\nAnd you're qualified to me\nWhat can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already\nWe make our own sense\nAnd you're qualified\nAnd you're qualified\n\nOnly losers go to school\nThey can't teach what they can't prove\nCome put this inside a test-tube\nBecause stupid's next to \"I love you\"\n\nSo what can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already?\nWe make our own sense\nYou're qualified to me\nWhat can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already?\n'Cause we make our own sense\nAnd you're qualified\n\nAnd you're qualified to-\n\nAnd you're qualified\n\nAnd now that we're all grown up\nWho do we owe it to?\nAnd now that we've gone this far\nWho do we owe it all to?\nWe did it all alone\nNow we're coming for the throne\nWe did it all alone\nNow we're coming for the throne\nAnd now that we all came up\nDo we lose? Do we lose?\n\nSo what can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already?\n'Cause we make our own sense\nAnd you're qualified to me\nWhat can you show me\nThat my heart don't know already?\n'Cause we make our own sense\nAnd you're qualified to me\nAnd you're qualified to me"}
