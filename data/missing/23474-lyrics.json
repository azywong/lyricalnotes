(No...)\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nBut you won't let me\nYou upset me girl\nAnd then you kiss my lips\nAll of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)\nCan't remember what you did\n\n(Rihanna)\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly what to do\nSo that I can't stay mad at you\nFor too long that's wrong\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly how to touch\nSo that I don't want to fuss and fight no more\nSaid I despise that I adore you\n\n(Rihanna)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)\nI can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy (ooh whoa...)\nBut I just can't let you go\nAnd I hate that I love you so (ooh...)\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nYou completely know the power that you have\nThe only one that makes me laugh\n\n(Rihanna)\nSaid and it's not fair\nHow you take advantage of the fact\nThat I... love you beyond a reason why\nAnd it just ain't right\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nAnd I hate how much I love you girl\nI can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)\nAnd I hate how much I love you girl\nBut I just can't let you go\nBut I hate that I love you so\n\n(Both)\nOne of these days maybe your magic won't affect me\nAnd your kiss won't make me weak...\nBut no one in this world knows me the way you know me\nSo you'll probably always have a spell on me...\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nYeah... ooh...\n\n(Rihanna)\nThat's how much I love you (how much I need you)\nThat's how much I need you (how much I love you)\nThat's how much I love you (oh, need you)\nThat's how much I need you\n\nAnd I hate that I love you so...\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy\nI can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy\nBut I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no...)\nAnd I hate that I love you so\n\n(Both)\nAnd I hate that I love you so... so."}
