It Ain't Hard To Tell!\n\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nI'm like ooh daddy, I see you do the damn thang'\nGot my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign\nI like you but, I really like your damn chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nIt kinda explains the way she be actin'\nShe liked my necklace so she started relaxin'\nNow that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!\n\n(Verse 1: Fabolous)\nYo, You think they like me now, wait until the light hit me,\nI bet the house somebody girl spend the night with me,\nThey gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters,\nThis kinda necklace turn on the investigators,\nThey ain't got one problem with this,\nSquare face watch look like Sponge Bob on the wrist,\nOne white, one gold, one nice, untold,\nYou can look but don't touch, Guns might unload, now\nI respect them thugs who get they jackin' on,\nBut we squeeze to every slug that we be packin's long,\nYa boy got the drug money we be stackin on,\nLotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on,\nGet 'em close and, lookin' like a scooped up-\n-The Titanic chain, from the bottom of the ocean,\nI play them diamonds well when I got dat jewelery on,\nAnd she called the Carrot Jeter maybe Canary Bonds\n\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nI'm like ooh daddy, I see you do the damn thang'\nYou go tmy vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign\nI like you but, I really like your damn chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nIt kinda explains the way she be actin'\nShe liked my necklace so she started relaxin'\nNow that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!\n\n(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)\nAh! My name is Weezy F Baby! Oww!\nI usually don't do this, ha! Ok, I'm lyin'\n'Cause these diamonds of mine, just sparkle like wine,\nI'm easy to find, In the dark or night time,\nI get so much attention from ya' eyes, like signs,\nI'm, kushed out my mind, Patron shots with lime,\nMy necklace is a crime,\nDamn that bitch fine, what that girl name,\n\n\nI call my jeweler up and tell 'em \"Make that girl a chain!\"\nI take that girl to Spain, she can't pronounce a thang\nAnd she got her girlfriend on the side like fame,\nThe fetish is Lli Wayne, I'm bombin' like Hussein,\nBut I'm that fire, now swallow my Butane,\nResidin' on a plane, the sky is my domain,\nI'm in and out the country, passports, and sweat-shorts,\nAnd tanktops, and sweet thoughts, from sun shades, and private airports,\nAnd of course... (Watchu got boy), I got...\n\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nI'm like ooh daddy, I see you with that damn thang'\nGot my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign\nI like you but, I really like your damn chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nIt kinda explains the way she be actin'\nShe liked my necklace so she started relaxin'\nNow that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!\n\n(Verse 3: Fabolous)\nYo, maybe it's them VV's, 'cause they sets Susters',\nSit on the next bus like that show on MTV,\nThe wings on the chain, make a nigga fly like the wings on a plane,\nWhen you sittin' in between em',\nEven when you clean em', Glistenin' when you see em'\nBeemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the \"Phenom\"'\nOops! I mean Phantom, my words got \"Tangled\" man,\nBut this Tiger strike, watch, make this bitch a Bengals fan,\nWe all know Jacob, check the shit he did,\nWe spent more time, \"Making The Band\" than Diddy did,\nYou feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse,\nI'm out in DC, at the \"White and Gold House\"...\nWanna convince me love, Secret Service meet me with some of that Lewinsky love,\nShe saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since,\nNow that's what I call a real \"Chain of Events\"! Nigga,\n\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nI'm like ooh daddy, I see you do the damn thang'\nGot my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign\nI like you but, I really like your damn chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nDiamonds In My Damn Chain!\nIt kinda explains the way she be actin'\nShe liked my necklace so she started relaxin'\nNow that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!\n\nDiamonds On My Damn Chain!
