Hammer time!\n\nGo with the flow it is said\nIf you can't groove to this, then you probably are dead\nSo wave your hands in the air\nBust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair\nThis is it for a winner\nDance to this and you're gonna get thinner\nMove, slide your rump\nJust for a minute, let's all do the bump\n\nBump, bump, bump (Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)\nYeah (You can't touch this)\nLook, man (You can't touch this)\nYou'll better get hyped boy 'cause you know you can't (You can't touch this)\nRing the bell, school's back in\nBreak it down!\n\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh)\nStop! Hammer time!\n(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh...)\n\n(You can't touch this)\n(You can't touch this)\n(You can't touch this)\nBreak it down!\n\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh-oh oh)\nStop! Hammer time!\n(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nEvery time you see me, that Hammer's just so hype\nI'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic\nNow why would I ever stop doing this?\nWith others makin' records that just don't hit\nI toured around the world from London to The Bay\nIt's \"Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer!\" and the rest can go and play\n\nYou can't touch this\n(You can't touch this)\n(You can't touch this)\nYeah, you can't touch this\nI told you, can't touch this\nToo hype, can't touch this\nYo, we outta here, can't touch this"}
