Ooh!\nSome say it's just a part of it;\nWe've got to fulfill the book.\n\n\n\nWon't you help to sing these songs of freedom?\n'Cause all I ever have:\nRedemption songs,\nRedemption songs.\n\nEmancipate yourselves from mental slavery,\nNone but ourselves can free our minds.\nHave no fear for atomic energy,\n'Cause none of them can stop the time.\nHow long shall they kill our prophets\nWhile we stand aside and look?\nYes, some say it's just a part of it,\nWe've got to fulfill the book.\n\nWon't you help to sing these songs of freedom?\n'Cause all I ever had:\nRedemption songs.\nAll I ever had:\nRedemption songs.\nThese songs of freedom,\nSongs of freedom."}
