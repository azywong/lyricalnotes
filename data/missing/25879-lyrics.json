Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nEven if the stars and moon collide\nI never want you back into my life\nYou can take your words and all your lies\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nI can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you\nYou don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you\n\nOh no, not anymore\nOh no, not anymore\nYou had your shot, had your shot\nBut you let go\n\nNow if we meet out on the street, I won't be runnin' scared\nI'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air\n\nAnd make you understand\nAnd make you understand\nYou had your chance, had your chance\n\nBut even if the stars and moon collide\nI never want you back into my life\nYou can take your words and all your lies\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nEven if the stars and moon collide\nI never want you back into my life\nYou can take your words and all your lies\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nCher Lloyd\nYeah, listen up!\nHey, hey, never look back\nDumbstruck boy, ego intact\nLook boy, why you so mad?\nSecond guessin', but should've hit that\n\nHey Demi, you picked the wrong lova\nYou shoulda picked that one, he's cuter than the other\nI just wanna laugh 'cause you're tryna be a hipster\nKick him to the curb, take a Polaroid picture\n\nDemi Lovato\nBut even if the stars and moon collide\nI never want you back into my life\nYou can take your words and all your lies\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nEven if the stars and moon collide\nI never want you back into my life\nYou can take your words and all your lies\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care\n\nOh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care"}
