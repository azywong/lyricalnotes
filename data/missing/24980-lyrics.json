You ain't even got to ask\n'Cause I'mma drink it all like, like it's my last\nShe a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass\nShe even look better by the end of my glass\nSee I just walked in fresher than the Certs off in this muthafucka\nI'mma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muthafucka\nI'mma go hard 'til it hurts off in this muthafucka\nI'm a boss so you gotta work off in this muthafucka\nThe work, and I can get you anything you want\nI could, I could, I could put you on\nSee you look like Beyonc&#xE9; so do it like Beyon\nDo it like Beyonc&#xE9; and put it on Sean\nGrind hard but a got a lot to show for it\nAlways had drive like I had to chauffeur it\nMy team's so true we should get a camera crew\nTo follow us around and make a show for us\n\nAnd I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this night up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last\nSwear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like\nLike I never had it at all\n\nNow, I'mma fill this glass up like it's my last\nI'mma blow this bag up like it's my last\nI'mma spend this cash up like it's my last\nAnd I'mma make it last, like it's my last\nAnd I'm gone, can't remember where I am\nBut she forget about her man when they tell her who I am\nAnd they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space\nAll all up in my face like you remember who I am\nSince I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean\nUp in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton\nRos&#xE9; rose over a little Chandon\nPut her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John\nMan I just ended up on everybody guest list\nI'm just doing better than what everyone projected\nKnew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel\nI'mma just tell you, it's everything that I expected\nBitch, boi\n\nHands up in the air\n(I do it. One time for the West side, let me see them hands..)\nHands up in the air (boi)\n(Two times if you love G.O.O.D Music)\nHands up in the air (boi boi boi boi)\n(And 3 times for the baddest chick in the World who got her hands up in the air)\nHands up in the air (I do it)\n\nAnd I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this night up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last\nSwear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like\nLike I never had it at all\n\nBig ass bottles, Big Ice buckets\nI work too hard to be ballin' on a budget\nMe and my people do it big out in public 'cause\n'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doing nothing\n\nAnd I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this night up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last\nSwear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like\nLike I never had it at all\n\nD-Town.
