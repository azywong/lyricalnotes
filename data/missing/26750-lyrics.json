City\nRight about now\nIf a judge for life me, would you stay by my side?\nOr is ya gonna say goodbye?\nCan you tell me right now?\nIf I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life\nShawty, would it be alright?\nCome and show me that you're down\n\nNow tell me would you really ride for me?\nBaby tell me would you die for me?\nWould you spend your whole life with me?\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\n\nTell me would you really cry for me?\nBaby don't lie to me\nIf I didn't have anything\nI wanna know would you stick around?\n\nAdam Levine\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\n\nR. City\nLet's get it diddly-down-down-down\nAll I want is somebody real who don't need much\nA gal I know that I can trust\nTo be here when money low\nIf I did not have nothing else to give but love\nWould that even be enough?\nGal meh need fi know\n\nNow tell me would you really ride for me?\nBaby tell me would you die for me?\nWould you spend your whole life with me?\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\n\nTell me would you really cry for me?\nBaby don't lie to me\nIf I didn't have anything\nI wanna know would you stick around?\n\nAdam Levine\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\n\nR.
