Smith","spotify_id":"3CO19cTl5zzlWx9GWEpOhD","lyrics":"Sittin' in the rain\nWater on your brain\nGot a hole in your boat\nTrying to stay afloat\nHas got you down\nI've got a wind in my sail\nRubber boots and a pail\nI'll throw you a line\nRest assured that I\nWon't ever let you drown\n\n'Cause when you're up against the wall\nYou know I'll be here for you, for you\nWhen you rise and when you fall\nI'll always be here for you, for you\n\nWhen the plans you make\nFall through and take you\nFor a loop\nOr some bird has flown the coop\nAnd left you stranded\nJust lean on me\nAnd together you see\nWe'll carry the load\nEven if we don't\nQuite understand it\n\n'Cause when you're up against the wall\nYou know I'll be here for you, for you\nWhen you rise and when you fall\nI'll always be here for you, for you\n\n'Cause when you're up against the wall\nYou know I'll be here for you, for you\nWhen you rise and when you fall\nI'll always be here for you, for you"}
