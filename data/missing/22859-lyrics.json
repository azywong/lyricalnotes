Ooh\n\nCan you feel it building?\nLike a wave the ocean just can't control\nConnected by a feelin', ooh, in our very souls\nRising till it lifts us up, so everyone can see\n\nWe're breakin' free\nWe're soarin', flyin'\nThere's not a star in heaven that we can't reach\nIf we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free\nOh, we're breakin' free! Ooh\n\nRunnin', climbin'\nTo get to the place to be all that we can be\nNow's the time\nSo we're breakin' free, we're breakin' free, ooh yeah\n\nMore than hope, more than faith\nThis is truth, this is fate\nAnd together we see it coming\nMore than you, more than me\nNot a want, but a need\nBoth of us, breaking free\n\nWe're breakin' free\nWe're soarin', flyin'\nThere's not a star in heaven that we can't reach\nIf we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free\nOh, we're breakin' free! Ooh\n\nRunnin', climbin'\nTo get to the place to be all that we can be\nNow's the time\nSo we're breakin' free, we're breakin' free, ooh yeah"}
