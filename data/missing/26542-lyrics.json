Rumors fly\nAnd I know you've heard about me\n\nSo, hey, let's be friends\nI'm dying to see how this one ends\nGrab your passport and my hand\nI could make the good girls bad for a weekend\n\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when it's over\nIf the high was worth the pain\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless\nOr with a nasty scar\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n\nCherry lips, crystal skies\nI could show you incredible things\nStolen kisses, pretty lies\nYou're the queen, baby, I'm your king\n\nFind out what you want\nBe that guy for a month\nBut the worst is yet to come\nOh no\n\nScreaming, crying, perfect storms\nI could make all the tables turn\nRose garden filled with thorns\nKeep you second guessing like, \"Oh my God\"\n\nWho is he? Who is he?\nI get drunk on jealousy\nBut you'll come back each time you leave\n'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream\n\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when it's over\nIf the high was worth the pain\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless\nOr with a nasty scar\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n\nGirls only want love if it's torture\nDon't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you, ugh\nIt's torture, it's torture, don't say I didn't warn you\nIt's torture, it's torture, don't say I didn't warn you\n\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when it's over\nIf the high was worth the pain\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless\nOr with a nasty scar\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name"}
