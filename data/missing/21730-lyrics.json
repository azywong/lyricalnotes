Prophit)\nIt's a blessin we woke up this mornin\nAll my colored folk stressin, come let's join hands\nGot to cope with the pressures of being po' man\nPapa taught me in order survive fear no man\nNappy blossom from the root, henceforth we gon' stand\nProphet grew from a juvenile to a grown man\nYa gotta take responsibility for ya own man\nZonin, two blunts a mo'nin, by sunrise sometimes\nI love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again\nDamn I hope you play this song again\nIt's soul cleansin, the melody just rev my engines\nTried a lot of things but usually just end up bending my ligaments,\nSearchin fa benjamins and all my folks locked in the tenaments\nAnd it don't make any sense (boi) children is innocent\nBroadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences\nStill low on my income, (why?) go 'head finish it"}
