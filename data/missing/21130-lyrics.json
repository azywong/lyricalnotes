Ah... ah..)\n\nUh...\n\nI was a girl about the floss;\nIt was all about the cost,\nHow much he spent on me.\n\nSeek for a man who's got the means\nTo be giving you diamond rings,\nIt's what every fly girl\nCould want or even dream.\n\nBut I'm not every girl,\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me.\n\n'Cause shorty got a job,\nShorty got a car,\nShorty can pay her own rent.\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart.\nNo, oh.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling,\nGot my own thing,\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green,\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of,\nA man that understands real love.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling,\nGot my own thing\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green,\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of,\nA man that understands real love...\n\n(Uh-uh, uh-uh)\n(Yeah...)\n(Oh, yeah...)\n\nI'm not every girl,\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me, no.\n\n'Cause shorty got a job,\nShorty got a car,\nShorty can pay her own rent,\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart...\n\nBut I'm not every girl,\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me.\n\nNo, shorty got a job,\nShorty got a car,\nShorty can pay her own rent,\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart...\nOh, no.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling,\nGot my own thing,\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green,\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of,\nA man that understands real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling,\nGot my own thing\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green,\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of,\nA man that understands real love..."}
