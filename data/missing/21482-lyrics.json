Ooh whoa, whoa!\n\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that you're feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me.\nSo won't you dance with me... dance with me.\nMy drop top's in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot.\nBut we still got a little more time to rock\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me!\n\n(Slim:) I can see it in your eyes that you're looking at the time. You wanna\nLeave this party and I know you wanna leave with me. To chill with me, to\nDrink with me, to freak with me, oh baby!\n\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that you're feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me.\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me.\nMy drop top's in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot.\nBut we still got a little more time to rock\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me!\n\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that you're feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me.\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me.\nMy drop top's in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot.\nBut we still got a little more time to rock\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me!\n\n(Slim:) Everybody sing along...\n(112:) If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands\n(Clap clap-clap... clap, clap clap)\nIf you're sexy and you know it clap your hands\n(Clap clap-clap... clap, clap clap)\nIf you're sexy and you know it and you really wanna show it,\nIf you're sexy and you know it clap your hands\n(Clap clap-clap... clap, clap clap) Yeah!\n\n(Chorus:) (x3-to fade)\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that you're feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me.\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me.\nMy drop top's in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot.\nBut we still got a little more time to rock\nSo would you dance with me... dance with me!"}
