Not in years\nHow about her? No but I hear\nShe's in Queens with the man of her dreams\nFunny back then she said that about you\n\nQue sera you'll never guess who I saw\nRemember Johnny B remember him we're best friends practically\nLet's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?\nCan't believe how time flies by\nLeaving you makes me wanna cry\n\nThese bruises make for better conversation\nLoses the vibe that separates\nIt's good to let you in again\nYou're not alone in how you've been\nEverybody loses, we all got bruises\nWe all got bruises\n\nI would love to fix it all for you\nI would love to fix you too\nPlease don't fix a thing whatever you do\n\nThese bruises make for better conversation\nLoses the vibe that separates\nIt's good to know you've got a friend\nThat you remember now and then\nEverybody loses\n\nThese bruises make for better conversation\nLoses the vibe that separates\nIt's good to let you in again\nYou're not alone in how you've been\nEverybody loses, everybody loses, everybody loses\nWe all got bruises, We all got bruises, We all got bruises"}
