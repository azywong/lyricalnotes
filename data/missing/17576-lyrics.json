Ow!\nBabe\nOh, babe\n\nPeople tell me I can't have everything\nBut still I wanna have it all\nThey say I cannot succeed in life\nThat I'll get so far and then I'll fall\n\nI don't need no negative outlook\nI don't need nobody putting me down\nDon't they know that talk is useless?\nNothing's gonna keep my feet on the ground\n\nBecause I'm on the way up\nI've got it all 2gether\nNothing's gonna hold me back\nYeah, I'm on the way up\nI'm only gettin' better\nNow tell me what you think about that, look out!\n\nIf and when you make it\nAll kinds of people come around\nSome of them in your corner\nSome of them put you down\nBut one thing they all agree on\nIs that you are gonna change\nWhen all along they're the only ones\nWho never ever remain the same\nNow tell me which one of us changed?\n\nOnly fools don't take chances\nIf you wanna be on top\nU gotta work every single moment\n'Cause another's after your spot\nAll the suckers scream and shout\nThey don't know what it's all about\nThis is my world\nAnd I'm sorry, this table is reserved\n\nI'm on the way up\nI've got it all 2gether\nNothing's gonna hold me back\nOh no, 'cause I'm on the way up\nOnly gettin' better\nNow tell me what you think, tell me what you think about that\n\nOh\nOh yeah\n\nI'm on the way up\nI've got it all 2gether\nNothing's gonna hold me back\nOh, because I'm on the way up\nI'm only gettin' better\nTell me what you think, tell me what you think about that, oh no\n\n(On the way up) {repeat in BG}\nPeople think I can't have everything\nBut I'm gonna get it all\nI'm on the way up\nNothing's gonna make me fall\nNo, no, no\nNow what you think about that?\nTell me what you think about that!\nUh huh, thought so"}
