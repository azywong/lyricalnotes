Yeah\n\nI lay my head on my pillow\nYou got me starring out the window\n\n\n\nWish on a star for a sign\nWhat's the reason why? Yeah\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around I get shy\n(Babe) When I see you\nWhen I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you\n(Babe) When I see you\n\nSomething now is taking over me\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm not gonna run I'm,\nJust gonna stand here and see\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around I get shy\n(Babe) When I see you\nWhen I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you\n(Babe) When I see you\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around I get shy\n(Babe) When I see you\nWhen I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you\n(Babe) When I see you"}
