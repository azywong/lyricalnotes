I wonder if there's more of you\nShe's got my attention, she's confident\n\nOh no no, oh no no\nShe's confident\nOh no no, oh no no\nAnd I'm down with it\nOh no no, oh no no\nShe's confident\nYou could tell by the way she walks in the room\n\nShe said it's her first time\nI think she might of lied\nFeels so good damn, and I don't know why\nI'm addicted, something like a headache\nGot me twisted, but still I gotta have it\nExplosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)\nIt's not hard to notice, that I'm open\nHypnotized by the way she moves\n\nThen she started dancing, sexual romancing\nNasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece\nWhat's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you\nShe's got my attention, she's confident\n\nOh no no, oh no no\nShe's confident\nOh no no, oh no no\nAnd I'm down with it\nOh no no, oh no no\nShe's confident\nYou could tell by the way she walks in the room\n\nShe said it's her first time\nI think she might of lied\nFeels so good damn, and I don't know why\nI'm addicted, something like a headache\nGot me twisted, but still I gotta have it\n\nShe said it's her first time\nI think she might of lied\nFeels so good damn, and I don't know why\nI'm addicted, something like a headache\nGot me twisted, but still I gotta have it\n\nStill I gotta have it\nStill I gotta have it\nStill I gotta have it\nOh no no, oh no no\nOh no no, oh no no\nOh no no, oh no no\nOh no no, oh no no\nBut still I gotta have it"}
