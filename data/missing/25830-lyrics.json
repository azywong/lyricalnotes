I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,\nDo my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,\n\"Do she love me, do she love me not?\" (Love me not...)\nI ain't a player, I just crush a lot...\n\nAriana:\nYou give me that kind of something,\nWant it all the time, need it every day...\nOn a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred;\nNever get enough, I can't stay away...\n\nIf you want it, I got it, I got it every day;\nYou can get whatever you need from me...\nStay by your side, I'll never leave you,\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper\n\nSo don't you worry - baby, you got me...\n\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it... (Aye!)\nAnd I don't care who sees it, babe;\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...\n\nI love the way (you make me feel,)\nI love the way... (I love it, I love it...)\nBaby, I love the way (you make me feel,)\nOoh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...\n\nOoh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin',\nWhen you put your lips on mine\nAnd honey, it's ain't a question (q-question,)\n'Cause boy, I know just what you like...\n\nSo If you need it, I got it, I got it every day;\nBe your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me...\nStay by your side! (I'll never leave you...)\nSaid I ain't going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper...\n\nSo don't you worry - baby, you got me...\n\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it... (Aye!)\nAnd I don't care who sees it, babe;\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...\n\nI love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)\nI love the way... (I love it, I love it...)\nBaby, I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)\nOoh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...\n\nMac:\nUh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine;\nI hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind...\nYou're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time;\nSaid your bed be feeling lonely, so you're sleeping in mine,\nCome and watch a movie with me - \"American Beauty\"\nOr \"Bruce Almighty\" that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...\nI got some feelings for you I'm not gonna get bored of,\nBut baby, you an adventure, so let me come and explore you...\n\nAriana:\nSo don't you worry - baby, you got me...\n\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it... (Aye!)\nAnd I don't care who sees it, babe;\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...\n\nI love the way...  (I love the way you make me feel,)\nI love the way...  (I love it, I love it...)\nBaby, I love the way...  (I love the way you make me feel,)\nOoh, I love the way! (I love it, I love it...)\n\nI love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)\nI love the way... (I love it, I love it...)\nBaby, I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)\nOoh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...\n\nThe way I love you...\nYou, you, yeah, the way...\n\nI love the way you make me feel,\nI love it, I love it...\nI love the way you make me feel,\nI love it - the way I love you..."}
