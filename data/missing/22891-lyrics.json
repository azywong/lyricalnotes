hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud, I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nGrindin' to see if they can see me lean\nI'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen\nPolice see me ride by, they can see the glean\nAnd my shine on the deck and the TV screen\n\nRide with a new chick, she like &#x201C;hold up&#x201D;\nNext to the PlayStation controller\nIs a full clip in my pistola\nTurn a jacker into a coma\n\nGirl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone\nJust tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies\nRide clean as hell, so I pull in ladies\nLaws on patrol and you know they hate me\n\nMusic turned all the way up into the maximum\nI got speakers, some niggas try to jack for some\nBut we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em\nWill have a nigga locked up in the maximum\n\nSecurity cell, I'm grippin' oak\nMusic loud and I'm tippin' slow\nTwin's steady twistin' like &#x201C;Hit this dough&#x201D;\nPolice pull up right behind and is in his throat\n\nWindows down, gotta stop pollution\nCD changes, niggas like, &#x201C;Who is that producin'?&#x201D;\nThis the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'\nGot warrants in every city except Houston\nBut I still ain't losin'\n\nThey see me rollin', they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud ,I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nI been drinkin' and smokin'\nHoldin' shit cause a brother can't focus\nI gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope\nThis big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve\n\nA nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey\nAnd the gin again, it's in again, we in the wind\nDoin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt\nAnd rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck\n\nI got a blunt up my right hand\n40 oz. in my lap freezin' my balls\nRoll another tree, green leaves and all\nComin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs\n\nYo, I gotta get back to backstreets\nWonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat\nGlock-Glock, shots to the block, we creep-creep\nPop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key\n\nWith no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like &#x201C;fuck 'em all&#x201D;\nBut I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all\nKeep a gun in car and a blunt to spark\nBut well if you want, nigga, you poppin' dark\nReady or not, we bust shots off in the air\nKrayzie Bone and Chamillionaire\n\nThey see me rollin', they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud, I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nNow do what you think it so, I tried to let you go\nTurn on my blinker light and then I swang it slower\nAnd they upset for sho cause they think they know\nThat they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro\n\nSo they get behind me tryin' to check my tags\nLook at my rearview and they smilin'\nThinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, well keep tryin'\nSteady denyin' that it's racial profilin'\n\nHouston, Texas, you can check my tags\nPull me over try to check my slab\nGlove compartment, gotta get my cash\nCause the crooked cops try to come up fast\n\nAnd bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them\nGivin' a damn about not feelin' my attitude\nWhen they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty\nBet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood\n\nI'ma laugh at you, and then I'm a have to cruise\nYeah, my number two on some old DJ Screw\nYou can't arrest me, plus you can't sue\nThis a message to the laws, tellin' them &#x201C;We hate you&#x201D;\n\nI can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known\nTippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome\nBookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone\nLike they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home\nAnd it's on\n\nThey see me rollin', they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud, I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nThey see me rollin', they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud, I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty"}
