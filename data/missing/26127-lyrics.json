I just gotta find my pants.)\n\nRolling up, I'm on the scene\nWant you here right next to me, right next to me\nYeah, yeah, 'cause this is our night\nAin't got no deadlines\nThere's nowhere else I'd rather be\n\nCall everyone you know\nTurn up the radio\n'Cause this is our song\nWe can do no wrong\nAre you ready, are you ready to go?\n\nThis Saturday we're gonna party all night\nOne we will remember the rest of our lives\nThis Saturday we're gonna do it bigger than we ever have before\nI don't want this Saturday to end\nI don't want this Saturday to end\nI don't want this Saturday to end\n\nYesterday was Friday, today is Saturday\nWe're gonna live like there's no tomorrow\nWouldn't have it any other way\n\nThis Saturday we're gonna party all night\nOne we will remember the rest of our lives\nThis Saturday we're gonna do it bigger than we ever have before\nI don't want this Saturday to end\nI don't want this Saturday to end\nI don't want this Saturday to end"}
