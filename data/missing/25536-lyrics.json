(Chronic)\nRozay and Usher Raymond, girl we the hottest\nRockin' the most ice, I said we the hottest\n\n(Usher)\nYou can say it all night long\nThat you couldn't wait to get me home alone\nWhat you gon' do to me\nDon't talk about it, be about it\nLemme see, lemme see, lemme see\n\nGirl I can't wait to get you home\nTalk a good game mate, come on\nHoller 'bout what you gon' do to me\nDon't talk about it, be about it\nLemme see, lemme see, lemme see"}
