I know now\nThat's why it's only done out of love\nWhat I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma\n\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\n\nWhat I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me\nBut I'ma let you know what's been goin' on lately\nNow you know since you left, a lot of things wit' yo kids done changed\nYeah Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James\n\nAin't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you\nAnd Renee's back in jail, you know she talk like you\nRicule's doin' real good now, she workin'\nRhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'\n\nBuckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind\nAnd Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine\nKylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self\nAs for my father... well, that's somethin' else\n\nBut that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down\nMy great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town\nBud that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing\nOnce more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring\n\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\n\nYou left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grand-kids\nAnd since then, two of yo' grand-kids done had kids\nThey had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right\nXavier made you a great grandmother\n\nI thank you for the best times of my life\nI thank you for when you first met her, acceptin' and lovin' my wife\nI thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital\nI thank you for my - life, I thank you for the bible\n\nI thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'\n(Amazing Grace..) while I'm yawnin'\nI thank you for them two beatin's you gave me\n'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from them two beatin's saved me\n\nAnd when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me\n'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me\nBut life like everything comes to an end\nI pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen\n\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\n\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\nBaby it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that)\nBaby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')\n\nAmazing Grace, how sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me\nI once was lost, but now I'm found\nWas blind, but now I see, yeah"}
