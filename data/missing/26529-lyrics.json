One day you'll understand\n\nSo hear me out, hear me out\nI won't go, I won't go\nNo goodbyes, no goodbyes\nJust hello, just hello\nAnd when you cry, I will cry\nAnd when you smile, I will smile\nAnd next time when I look in your eyes\nWe'll have wings and we'll fly\n\nHello my only one, just like the morning sun\nYou'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name\nAnd you're still my chosen one, remember who you are\nNo you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes\n\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nTell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-\nI just want you to do me a favor\nTell Nori about me, tell Nori about me\nTell Nori about me, tell Nori about me\nTell Nori about me, tell Nori about me\nTell Nori about me, tell Nori about me\nTell Nori about me..."}
