Give me something\nI need your love, I need your love, I need your loving\nYou got that kind of medicine that keeps me coming\n\nMy body needs a hero, come and save me\nSomething tells me you'll know how to save me\nI've been feeling real low\nOh, I need you to come and rescue me\n\nMake me come alive, come on and turn me on\nTouch me, save my life, come on and turn me on\nI'm too young to die, come on and turn me on\nTurn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on\n\nMake me come alive, come on and turn me on\nTouch me, save my life, come on and turn me on\nI'm too young to die, come on and turn me on\nTurn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on\n\nBoy, I'm aching, make it right\nMy temperature is super high\nIf I scream, if I cry\nIt's only 'cause I feel alive\n\nMy body needs a hero, come and save me\nSomething tells me you'll know how to save me\nI've been feeling real low\nOh, I need you to come and rescue me\n\nMake me come alive, come on and turn me on\nTouch me, save my life, come on and turn me on\nI'm too young to die, come on and turn me on\nTurn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on\n\nMake me come alive, come on and turn me on\nTouch me, save my life, come on and turn me on\nI'm too young to die, come on and turn me on\nTurn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on\n\nYou've got my life in the palm of your hands\nCome and save me now, I know you can\n\nDon't let me die young\nI just want you to father my young\nI just want you to be my doctor\nWe can get it cracking chiropractor\nI know you can save me and make me feel alive\n\nMake me come alive, come on and turn me on\nTouch me, save my life, come on and turn me on\nI'm too young to die, come on and turn me on\nTurn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on"}
