I'm tryin' to get me some\nWork it nice and slow, when the bass get low\nJump up on the table and lose control\n\nFucked up, fucked up, wasted, wasted\nGo crazy, get shit-faced\nLet's get it crunk, let's get drunk\nLet's get buck-ass wild, tear it up\n\nWhen the bass is low, you work it nice and slow\nYou let your body go\n(Shake it 'til the break of dawn)\nWe can take a shot of anything they got\nDance on the tabletop\n\nBut hey, I don't care\nWherever there's a party, I'm the first one with a drink in the air\nWe can share, 'cause when we finish this one\nThere will be another bottle right here\n\nWe don't want this night to end\nWe won't sleep, then we'll do it again\nWe don't want this night to end\nWe won't sleep, then we'll do it again\n\nPour me another one, pour me another one, pour me another one\nPour me another one, pour me another one, pour me another one\n'Cause when we finish this one\nThere will be another bottle right here"}
