I don't mind\n\nYou kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds\nDon't dull the sparkle in your eyes\nI know that we were made to break\nSo what? I don't mind\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nHoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nI am a fire, you're gasoline\nCome pour yourself all over me\nWe'll let this place go down in flames \nOnly one more time\n\nYou kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds\nDon't dull the sparkle in your eyes\nI know that we were made to break\nSo what? I don't mind\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nHoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n(Night night night night night...)\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nHoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?"}
