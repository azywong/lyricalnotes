Mary J Blige - \"Come Close\"\n\n(Verse 1) {Common}\nAre we living in a dream world?\nAre your eyes still green girl?\nI know you're sick and tired of arguing,\nBut you can't keep it bottled in\nJealousy, we gotta swallow it.\nYour heart and mind, Baby, follow it\nSmile, happiness, you can model it\nAnd when you feel opposite\nI just want you to know\nYour whole being is beautiful\nI'm 'a do the best I can do\n'Cause I'm the best when I'm with you\n\n(Chorus) {Mary J. Blige}\nCome close to me, Baby\nLet your love hold you\nI know this world gets crazy\nWhat's it without you? (nothing nothing)\n\n(Verse 2) {Common}\nPut down your bags, Love\nI know in the past, Love\nIt's been sorta hard on you\nBut I see the god in you\nI just wanna nurture it\nThough this love may hurt a bit\nWe dealing with this water love\nYou even give my daughter love\nI wanna build a tribe with you\nProtect and provide for you\nTruth is I can't hide from you\nThe pimp in me, may have to die with you\n\n(Chorus) {Mary J. Blige}\nCome close to me, Baby (Come close to me, Baby)\nLet your love hold you (Let your love hold you)\nI know this world gets crazy\nWhat's it without you? (What's this world without you)\n\n(Bridge) {Mary j. Blige}\nI know what you're thinking: You're on my mind\nYou're right, you're right, you're right\nYou promise too fast. it just might take time (slow down a minute babe)\nI hope you're not tired tonight, tonight\n\n(Verse 3) {Common}\nYou helped me to discover me\nI just want you to put trust in me\nI kinda laugh when you cuss at me\nThe aftermath is you touching me\nIt's destiny that we connected girl\nYou and I, we can affect the world\nI'm tired of the fast lane\nI want you to have my last name\n\n(Chorus) {Mary J. Blige}\nCome close to me, Baby (Come close to me, Baby)\nLet your love home you (Let me move you tonight, Baby)\nI know this world gets crazy\nWhat's it without you? (we gonna make it)\nI love you, I love you, I love you\n\n(Bridge till fade) {Mary j. Blige}\nI know what you're thinking: You're on my mind\nYou're right, you're right, you're right\nYou promise too fast. It just might take time\nI hope you're not tired tonight, tonight"}
