Yes. Baby I'm Jerry Lawler\nRebel with a cause; Outlaw with the lawyer\nJudge jury like a loop, Rap name Lupe,\nBut my daddy named me Warrior, this is his memorial.\n\nThought I was down\nThought I was gone\nThought I was around\nI left you alone\nLook up in the sky\nJust look up in the sky\nSee that I'm everywhere\nEverywhere\nShining down on you\n\nNo, I ain't the nigga trying to get a liqour line\nWhen I be scriptin lines, won't this petition sign\nIt says I'm sick of dimes, sick of this prison time\nI really love my people. I'm sick of pimpin' mine\nNow if we autotune that shit\nWe can hear the songs from that opera room fat bitch\nTell 'em it's not to pursue it, just shoe it like a blacksmith\nWe're trapped, and movin round in circles like its chap stick\nAnd that's the semi-circle way of thinkin' that we're chapped with\nWe'll rap is arounded ya head like the bandana's\nFabolous used to wrap his hats with\nRather being feds instead of National Geographic's\nWell I'm not havin' it, naw.\n\nThought I was down\nThought I was gone\nThought I was around\nI left you alone\nLook up in the sky\nJust look up in the sky\nSee that I'm everywhere\nEverywhere\nShining down on you\n\nSo, I say hello and this is for the third time\nTo everybody out there who ain't never heard mine\nAnd if you haven't you know you ain't never heard line\nLu don't moo. No cow words, you only heard lions\nNot a facade cherisher, I rather have the scars\nI don't idolize America, I'm dancing with the stars\nUh huh. All of them? Yeah they are, too.\nYou look up and you see us Shining Down on You.\n\nThought I was down\nThought I was gone\nThought I was around\nI left you alone\nLook up in the sky\nJust look up in the sky\nSee that I'm everywhere\nEverywhere\nShining down on you\n\nShining down on you\nShining down on you\nShining down on you"}
