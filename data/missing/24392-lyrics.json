(Ah).\n\nI can't believe what you said to me,\nLast night we were alone.\nYou threw your hands up,\nBaby, you gave up, you gave up.\n\nI can't believe how you looked at me,\nWith your James Dean glossy eyes.\nIn your tight jeans with your long hair,\nAnd your cigarette stained lies.\n\nCould we fix you if you broke?\nAnd is your punch line just a joke?\n\nI'll never talk again, oh,\nBoy, you've left me speechless.\nYou've left me speechless, so speechless.\n\nAnd I'll never love again, oh,\nBoy, you've left me speechless,\nYou've left me speechless, so speechless.\n\nI can't believe how you slurred at me,\nWith your half wired broken jaw.\nYou popped my heart seams,\nAll my bubble dreams, bubble dreams.\n\nI can't believe how you looked at me,\nWith your Johnnie Walker eyes.\nHe's gonna get you, and after he's through,\nThere's gonna be no love left to rye.\n\nAnd I know that it's complicated,\nBut I'm a loser in love, so, baby,\nRaise a glass to mend,\nAll the broken hearts,\nOf all my wrecked up friends.\n\nI'll never talk again, oh,\nBoy, you've left me speechless.\nYou've left me speechless, so speechless.\n\nAnd I'll never love again, oh,\nFriend, you've left me speechless,\nYou've left me speechless, so speechless.\n\nHow? How? How?\nHow? How? How?\n\nAnd after all the drinks,\nAnd bars that we've been to,\nWould you give it all up? (How?)\nCould I give it all up for you? (How)\n\nAnd after all the boys, \nAnd the girls that we've been through,\nWould you give it all up? (Give it all up.)\nCould you give it all up (Give it all up.)\nIf I promise, boy, to you?\n\nThat I'll never talk again,\nAnd I'll never love again.\nI'll never write a song,\nWon't even sing along,\nI'll never love again. How?\n\nSo speechless, eh, -ess.\nYou left me speechless, \nSo speechless, eh, yeah.\n\nWill you ever talk again? Oh,\nBoy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)\nYou left me speechless, so speechless.\n\nSome men may follow me,\nBut you choose death and company,\nWhy you so speechless, oh, oh?"}
