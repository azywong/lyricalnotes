yeah\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\n\nLudacris\nSing it hoes,\nAll over the world baby\nIt's only right that I share my experiences with y'all\n'Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine\nBut I'ma start at home, when I see a girl I like\nI walk straight up to her and I'm like (ugh)\nHey girl how ya doin' you are the woman that I'm really pursuin'\nI would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name\nIf you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, hey\nSee I'm the man of this town, and I hope you wouldn't mind\nIf I showed you around, so when you go to certain places\nYou'll be thinkin' of me, we got people to meet and many places to see, hey\nI'm really diggin' ya lips, but be careful\nWhere you walkin' when you swingin' them hips\nI'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash\nWit ya traffic jam booty heads pausin' so fast, hey\nI wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it\nI like ya hair and every style that ya wear it\nAnd how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes\nFrom your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes\n\nBobby Valentino\nOh yeah\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\n\nLudacris\nYou hear the song so dance\nDon't always think I'm tryna get in your pants\n'Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D\nI'm takin' you places you only see on TV\nTryna show ya that livin' is trife\nHow many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life\nOne day we on the autobahn swervin drivin'\nNext day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands\nIf you wit me ain't no time to sleep\nEspecially at wet willies on Miami Beach\nBut I drive you off and pay you no attention\nIf I make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention\nThen jump in the car and just ride for hours\nMakin' sure I don't miss the homecomin at Howard\nHawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see, so if\nYo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey\n\nBobby Valentino\nOh yeah\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\n\nLudacris\nI'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade\nThen at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand\nGrenades, outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest\nIn Mardigra all the women tryna show me they chest, hey\nI'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks\nWhile the ladies all beggin me to mash it up\nI had sad beginnings when I rap wit no fans\nNow it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey\nI used to think that it was way too cold till I went to Canada\nAnd saw some beautiful hoes, now I hit the caribana every year in Toronto\nThen fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh), Oh\nYet and still you would'nt believe your eyes if you went to Brazil\nAin't no need of even askin brah\nThe best women are reside in Africa, and that's real\n\nBobby Valentino\nOh yeah\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\nThe fancy cars, the women and the caviar\nYou know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world\n\nLudacris\nSing it hoes\n\n$Money Mike$\nPimpin' pimpin' pimpin', ladies and gentlemen as we ride out,\nCould we have all the real pimps,\nPlease put both of your pinky fingers high in the air,\nNow ladies look around wit me, lets see if we can weed some of these niggas out\n'Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin', no\nIf you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms\nLook like he been swimmin in shoulder height water\nPlease tell that nigga, put yo hands down,\nIf you smell like you been at work all day and your car\nPlease put your hands down, now look up at the pinky fingers\nThat are still in the air, if you see him ashy around the knuckles\nLike the nigga wash half of his hands and lotion three quarters of his body\nPlease say put yo hands down, if yo spinnin rims\nSpin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin',\nIf you are dancin on the dancefloor and you look to\nYo left and yo right and you do not see a woman in sight\nGuess what you guessed it you are not\nPimpin', if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood\nThat's because you didn't order Vodka buddy\nThat's why it's three dollars a glass\nPut your hands down, now look down, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg\nOne time ok, you see the nigga wit the white socks not pimpin'!\nSorry unless you tryna do the Beat It entorauge,\nIf your shoes have a buckle on, your not pimpin'"}
