And uh,\nI just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and\nIt's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and\nLord, would you help me? And stop this pain\nI keep inflinctin on my family (family)\nHustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'\nAnd losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'\nIt's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man\nAnd I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin' not to panic\n\nI try so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan I try so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault 'cause I...\nTried to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHoping one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow\nBut until then...\nI'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough\n\nI see thangs won't change\nI'm stuck in the game\nAs soon as I get out it\nKeeps pullin me back mayne\nGot me doin' dirty dirt\nSo used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work\nStudied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean\nHustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league\nSo we never leave never, till the sun came up\nGotta get it nope no leavin' no rush\nToday games they play gotta go hard to get what you put in\nIf you fall off then it's all on you\nGotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool\n\nI try so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan I try so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault 'cause i...\nTried to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHopin one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow\nBut until then...\nI'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough"}
