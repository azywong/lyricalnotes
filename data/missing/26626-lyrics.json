I'm just a tenant\nLandlord said these walls vacant more than a minute\nThese walls are vulnerable, exclamation\nInterior pink, color coordinated\nI interrogated every nook and cranny\nI mean it's still amazing before they couldn't stand me\nThese walls want to cry tears\nThese walls happier when I'm here\nThese walls never could hold up\nEvery time I come around demolition might crush\n\nIf these walls could talk\n(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)\nIf these walls could talk\n(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)\n\nIf these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep\nYelling at me continuously, I can see\nYour defense mechanism is my decision\nKnock these walls down, that's my religion\nWalls feeling like they ready to close in\nI suffocate, then catch my second wind\nI resonate in these walls\nI don't know how long I can wait in these walls\nI've been on these streets too long\nLooking at you from the outside in\nThey sing the same old song\nAbout how they walls always the cleanest\nI beg to differ, I must've missed them\nI'm not involved, I'd rather diss them\nI'd rather call on you, put your wall up\n'Cause when I come around demolition gon' crush\n\nIf these walls could talk\n(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)\nIf these walls could talk\n(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)\n\nIf your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late\nYour destiny accepted your fate\nBurn accessories and stash them where they are\nTake the recipe, the Bible and God\nWall telling you that commissary is low\nRace wars happening no calling CO\nNo calling your mother to save you\nHomies to say you're reputable, not acceptable\nYour behavior is Sammy the Bull-like\nA killer that turned snitch\nWalls is telling me you a bitch\nYou pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them\nThat sentence so important\nWalls telling you to listen to Sing About Me\nRetaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me\nKilled my homeboy and God spared your life\nDumb criminal got indicted same night\nSo when you play this song, rewind the first verse\nAbout me abusing my power so you can hurt\nAbout me and her in the shower whenever she horny\nAbout me and her in the after hours of the morning\nAbout her baby daddy currently serving life\nAnd how she think about you until we meet up at night\nAbout the only girl cared about you when you asked her\nAnd how she fucking on a famous rapper, walls could talk\n\nI remember you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in a hotel room"}
