Don't nobody deserve myself.\nOh no, baby what I'm saying is.\n\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nRight now, don't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nCalm down, don't rush, no pressure.\n\nThought that you were in it for the paper.\nNever thought I'd take you serious.\nNow I need you, not a moment later.\nLosin' it, I'm so delirious.\nAnd I'ma put up a fight for it.\nNever give up a love like this.\nFinally I found someone.\nThat can do me like no other.\nTalking to my conscience.\nI made a few mistakes.\nI did it to myself.\nI'm the only one to blame.\nI know you need a little while to believe again.\nTo love again.\n\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nRight now, don't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nI'll be waiting for you.\nDon't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nRight now, don't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nI'll still.\nDon't rush, no pressure.\n\nPut my key in the ignition.\nDon't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me.\nI know that you ain't got no plans to leave.\nGirl I need your attention.\nAnd every time I see you make that face.\nI wanna love you all over the place.\nDon't do it, baby.\nDon't do it to me, no.\n\nI know you don't wanna talk, right.\nWe've been on and off like the crosslights.\nYou heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?\nWhen I touch you, I get frostbite.\nGirl you're so cold, so cold, so cold.\nHow we so young but livin' so old?\nIn the bed together but we sleepin' solo.\nThat could drive you loco.\nYou supposed to me my uno, Yoko Ono.\nOh no, round two again.\nWe've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken\nLast time we argued eight straight days.\nI learned my lesson, I got straight As.\nAnd I know it's deeper than masseuses.\nOh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious\nGo ahead and take the time.\nBut it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine.\nThink about it.\n\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nRight now, don't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nI'll be waiting for you.\nDon't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nRight now, don't rush, no pressure.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up.\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nI'll still.\nDon't rush, no pressure.\n\nYou ain't gotta make your mind up right now.\nI know I did you wrong.\nLet your heart heal.\nDon't rush, no pressure."}
