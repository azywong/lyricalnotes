I'm illegally going 120\nEasy weaving in and out of the traffic\nThey cannot catch me, I'm smashing\nI'm ducking bucking them out here\nI'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic\nNow I know what it's like under the city lights\nRiding into the night, driving over the bridge\nThe same one we walked across as kids\nKnew I'd have a whip but never one like this\nOld school, old school, Candy paint, two seater\nYeah, I'm from Seattle, There's hella Honda Civics\nI couldn't tell you about paint either\nBut I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours\nAnd roll on over to the dealer\nAnd I found the car I'm dreaming of, as I bargain with this geezer\nGot the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming\n\nHollis\nGot that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\n\nScHoolboy Q\nBackwoods and dope\nWhite hoes in the backseat snorting coke\nShe doing line after line like she's writing rhymes\nI had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind\nCadillac pimpin', my uncle was on\n14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone\nSendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patr&#xF3;n\nRather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes\n(Fuckin' lottery homes)\nTires with the spokes on it and the vogues too\nMustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on 'em\nMy dogs hanging out the window\nYoung as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball\nTryna fuck 'em all, kill the fuckin' wimps\nSee what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch\nSlap her booty with my palms\nYou can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls\nI'm motherfuckin' awe... some\nSwear these eyes tryna hypnotize\nGrip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs\nSee the lust stuck up in her eyes\nMaybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?\nGirl does she want it low?\nThis shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know\nSo we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit\nGot a window tinted for showing gangstas in it\nSlide till the gas is finished, Q\n\nHollis\nGot that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\n\nGot that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright"}
