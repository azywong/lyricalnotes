Bitch I'm the man\nDon't you forget it\nThe way you walk, that's me\nThe way you talk, that's me\nThe way you've got your hair up: did you forget that's me?\nAnd the voice in your speaker right now: that's me\nAnd the voice in your ear: that's me\nCan't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it\nFirst I made you who you are, then I made it\nAnd you're wasted with your ladies\nYeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded\n\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me\nA shot for me\nA shot for me\n\n(Rick Ross - Verse 2)\nOk look: I'm honest\nGirl I can't lie: I miss you\nYou and the music were the only things that I commit to\nI never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you\nBut you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you\nShe says I know you changed, I never see you\n'Cause you're always busy doing things\nI really wish had a different way of viewing things\nI think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things\nIt's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen\nThe men are jealous and the women all in competition\nAnd now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret\nAnd taint all your images of your \"Mr. Perfect\"\nI could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer\nPraying for your happiness, hope that you recover\nThis is one I know you hated when you heard it\nAnd it's worse because you know that I deserve it...\n\nMay your neighbours respect you\nTrouble neglect you, angels protect you\nAnd heaven accept you\n\n(Lil Wayne - Verse 3)\nGirl you can believer Viacom V Of Doom\nI steal not supposed to shit, it's supposed to gems\nI'm not to world to be a shit from bitch\nYou like it to world shit like noodge\nHave to girl you Revolver and shit\nI like deserver for you to shit...\n\n(Jamie Foxx - Hook)\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me\nA shot for me\nA shot for me\nYou place for me\n\n(Nas - Verse 4)\nA best never to you, A best forever\nFor girl to me, I'm so deserver\nYou mean time, A long time\nThose it mean be from you I shit\nYou be to girl, Those be to girl\nI can believe sure to sure\nThis time to be deserver...\n\n(Jamie Foxx - Hook)\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me\nA shot for me\nA shot for me\nYou place for me\n\n(Kanye West - Verse 5)\nA guess to me from shit\nYou stronger a me from shot\nSteal me I can you to bitch niggas\nBitch niggas to you, Bitch niggas to me\nI can steal niggas bitch from shit\nYou deserver and can to shit...\n\n(Jamie Foxx - Hook)\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me, ooh\nTake a shot for me\nA shot for me\nA shot for me\nYou place for me\n\n(Twista - Verse 6)\nSong for shit to mind\nI can shit now and display it's not to shot for me or Viacom V Of Doom\nIt's fall for your type and Screen Gems S From Hell\nA shot for you to me\nYour night for girl\nA out for night or send you to sexy scary...\n\n(Jamie Foxx and Chris Brown - Hook)\nI swear I always\nFall for your type, yeah (for your type)\nTell me why I always\nFall for your type (for your type)"}
