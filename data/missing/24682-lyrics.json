Where my money at?\n\nBreak my bank\nForget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag\nMake it rain\nShawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank\n\nDamn, girl, you look better than the videos\nThink I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggie, though\nAll them groupie girls getting jealous of what I spendin'\nTryna chop it up, but I ain't the karate kid\n\nJaded, everyday I'm spending more on her\nI don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open\nEvery time I say this, it always get her one more\nWhen it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for\n\nBreak my bank\nGive everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot\nMake it rain\nWhere my money at? Where my money at?\n\nBreak my bank\nForget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag\nMake it rain\nShawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank\nMake me wanna break my, make me wanna break my bank\n\nOkay, the start of my day, I took her on a date\nHad to scrape for some change, so I went to the bank\nBut when I seen her, she was so damn fine like that\nSo I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks\nOverdrawn, low funds\n\nIt's, it's like I'm dumb\nBut I put it right back 'cause your boy is sprung\nMan she is so damn fine, got me spending all this cash\nMan, it's going too fast, I need to watch my ass\n\nYou make me wanna break my bank\nGive everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot\nMake it rain\nWhere my money at? Where my money at?\n\nBreak my bank\nForget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag\nMake it rain\nShawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank\nMake me wanna break my, make me wanna break my\n\nIf you a bad girl, and you need a little change\nTell your man go break his bank\nIf you a bad girl, and you tryin' to get paid\nTell your man go break his bank\n\nIf you a bad girl, and you need a little change\nTell your man go break his bank\nIf you a bad girl, and you tryin' to get paid\nTell your man go break his bank\n\nBreak my bank\nGive everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot\nMake it rain\nWhere my money at? Where my money at?\n\nBreak my bank\nForget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag\nMake it rain\nShawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank\nMake me wanna break my, make me wanna break my bank"}
