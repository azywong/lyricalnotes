Hello, goodbye\nOne day here, one day there, and again it's time to go\nMiss Popular, always on the road\nPut my best foot forward, gotta get on with the show\nStrike a pose for the front cover of a magazine\nEverywhere I arrive I get high fives\nThey paint me larger than life (Yeah)\n\nI'm just an ordinary girl\nSometimes I'm lazy, I get bored\nI get scared, I feel ignored\nI feel happy, I get silly\nI choke on my own words\nI make wishes, I have dreams\nAnd I still want to believe\nAnything can happen in this world\nFor an ordinary girl\n\nSo give it everything or nothing at all\nGet back on your feet when you stumble and fall\nA little luck can go a long way\nSo don't you worry about what people say\nWho knows where the wind may blow\nFor an ordinary girl?\n\nI'm just an ordinary girl\nSometimes I'm lazy, I get bored\nI get scared, I feel ignored\nI feel happy, I get silly\nI choke on my own words\nI make wishes, I have dreams\nAnd I still want to believe\nAnything can happen in this world\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me\nFor an ordinary girl\n\nMmm, for an ordinary girl\nLike me, like you"}
