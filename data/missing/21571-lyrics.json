I just wanna thank you\n\nI wanna thank you for the groups that came before me\nAll of y'all in the office that promote me on the streets\nAll the mom and pop store that don't get alot of credit\nThe spots in the hood the first ones that said it\nAll the mix show d'js please keep it pumpin\nThank you for your support and yes I'm gonna keep it comin'\nI love how you love that\nSo I'm givin' back\nCause ya the ones that kept this playa on track\nThe reason I'm seen\nIs because of you\nThe reason I'm heard and my dreams came true\nNow if you ever made a poster or wrote a fan letter\nAll I'm try'n do is show you some L-O-V-E\nAnd that you know without ya there is no me\nJD, JE, the whole SSD\nKnow if you ride for we Then I'ma ride for you\nFrom the bottom of my heart baby tell 'em what I wanna do"}
