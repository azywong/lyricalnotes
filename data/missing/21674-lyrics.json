Look what love gave us\nA world full of killing and blood spilling\nThat world never came\n\nAnd they say that a hero could save us\nI'm not gonna stand here and wait\nI'll hold on to the wings of the eagles\nWatch as they all fly away, ah-hah\n\nNow that the world isn't ending\nIt's love that I'm sending to you\nIt isn't the love of a hero\nAnd that's why I fear it won't do\n\nAnd they say that a hero could save us\nI'm not gonna stand here and wait\nI'll hold on to the wings of the eagles\nWatch as they all fly away\n\nAnd they're watchin' us (Watching us)\nThey're watchin' us (Watching us)\nAs they all fly away\nAnd they're watchin' us (Watching us)\nThey're watchin' us (Watching us)\nAs they all fly away, yeah (Yeah)\nAnd they're watchin' us  (Watching us)\nThey're watchin' us (Watching us)\nAs they all fly away, yeah, yeah\nWhoa, whoa"}
