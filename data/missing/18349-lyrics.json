How do you do?\n\nWell, here we are, spending time in the louder part of town\nAnd it feels like everything's surreal.\nWhen I get old I will wait outside your house\n'Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal.\n\nHow do you do the things that you do?\nNo one I know could ever keep up with you\nHow do you do!\nDid it ever make sense to you to say bye, bye, bye?"}
