Her whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nIt seems like for a while I've know ya\nNostalgic moments feels like magic don't it\nGirl you killin' 'em, my condolence\nThat's how you on it? Yeah that's how you on it\n\nAnd I'm gonna be with you\nNo matter what it takes\nRunning with scissors in the traffic\nTryna cut straight to the chase\n\nWanna be there when you wake\nWhen no make up on your face\nNot even gloss, before you brush\nLove your dimples when you blush\n\nIt's the simple things in life we take for granted 'cause we rush\nI just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine\nWhat's yo sign? I'm a Aries, I'm a 90's baby clearly\nI'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary\n\nHold up, hold up, hold up I just wanna know ya\nI heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder\nWell girl my vision's bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer\nCloser, now you right here where you suppose to\n\nOh, hey, there she go\nThat's the one I've got to know\nSuch a cutie right?\nHer whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nHow her hair flows when she walk\nLike a Love Jones when she talk\nSuch a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nExcuse me Misses, may I spark your interest\nCause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes\n(La, la)\nWhat you want you get it, I don't call it tricking\nNot just 'cause I got it 'cause I want to, that makes all the difference\n\nI'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business\nWe should get together soon so we can do some business\nI got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya\nIs you ready, what's the hold up\n\nYou ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama\nSmelling like flower balm and Escada\nShut it down and you won't even try ta\nYou such a boss but carry yourself like a lady\nThe baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating\n\nHold up, hold up, hold up I know what they say\nEvery rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye\nDon't believe it girl, I promise I'ma treat you like my treasure\nI'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better\n\nOh, hey, there she go\nThat's the one I've got to know\nSuch a cutie right?\nHer whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nHow her hair flows when she walk\nLike a Love Jones when she talk\nSuch a cutie right?

Her whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nHow her hair flows when she walk\nLike a Love Jones when she talk\nSuch a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nHey, her hair flows when she walk\nLike a Love Jones when she talk\nSuch a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight\nBut they don't do it like you\n\nThey don't do it like you\nThe cutest girl I've ever seen by the way\nYeah, yeah"}
