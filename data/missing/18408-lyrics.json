Wow !\nLove that power !\nBrothers and sisters -haha-\nRaise your hands up high and let me see the colors of your beautiful skin\n\nNow the ceremony begins\nLord, let thet heavenly rains cleanse\nRun into your nearest rainbow\nTo grab, hold, to ride on\nEach color, learn it ! The importance of each color...oh yeah\nLet it rain, let it rain, let it rain\nhaha\nyes\noh yeah"}
