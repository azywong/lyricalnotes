Don't pass me by sing!\n\nWhile on others thou are calling\nDo not pass me by\nDo not pass me by\n\nI've got the feeling but the feeling's not the same\nI did a little hip hop the hAmmer and the jam\nBut a touch, a touch from up above\nAnd I've got the feeling the feeling of your love reachin' out - reachin' out!\nAnd callin' for some people\nWho keep us all safe from this world that's full of evil trying! Trying!\nLord some times I'm crying\nThe son give his life, the people are still denying\nWhen I think of the goodness and what he's done for me my soul cries hallelujah!\nThanks for saving me! Sing!\n\nWhile on others thou are calling\nDo not pass me by\nDo not pass me by\n\nSavior savior\nHear my humble cry\nWhile on others thou are calling\nDo not pass me by\nDo not pass me by\n\nDo not - pass me by...\n\nI need him! I need him!\n\nWhile on others thou are calling\nDo not pass me by\nDo not pass me by"}
