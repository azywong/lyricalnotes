We're just so pretty!\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nJump the line, to the front\nDo what we like, get what we want\n(Where you at, Brit?) We're just so pretty!\n\nHey, don't you know that it's always the same?\nFrom Australia 'round to LA\nYou can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow\nWe be keeping them up on their toes\nThey can laugh, but they don't get the jokes\nJust you watch, they're so predictable\n(Some things don't change...)\n\n(The girls roll up) Windows roll down\n(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground\n(Watch them go) It's just so funny\n(Like bees to the honey!)\n\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nWipe the floor with all the boys\nPour the drinks, bring the noise\nWe're just so pretty!\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nJump the line, to the front\nDo what we like, get what we want\nWe're just so pretty!\n\nTell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?\nIs that why they be acting bizarre?\nEvery time I walk out of my house it's like, \"Hey, baby!\"\nThey don't see me rolling my eyes\nThey buzzing around me like flies\nThey got one thing on their minds\n(Some things don't change...)\n\n(The girls roll up) Windows roll down\n(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground\n(Watch them go) It's just so funny\n(Like bees to the honey!)\n\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nWipe the floor with all the boys\nPour the drinks, bring the noise\nWe're just so pretty!\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nJump the line, to the front\nDo what we like, get what we want\nWe're just so pretty!\n\nIggy Azalea\nIf you ask me, I'm killing them softly\nI would spend time with you but that'd cost me\nThey pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance\nBut busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance\nSee, enter in line between the beauty and a beast\nSlim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece\nBad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind\nAll of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time\nIggs\n\nBritney Spears\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nWipe the floor with all the boys\nPour the drinks, bring the noise\nWe're just so pretty!\nAll around the world, pretty girls\nJump the line, to the front\nDo what we like, get what we want\nWe're just so pretty!"}
