For all the pain?\n\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you\n\nThere are percussions, I'm missing your loving\nMust be the night, the ghost of a life\nAll of the memories\nA serenity dwindling my mind\nAll the time\n\nLike a permanent stain \nWishing I could just wash away, away\nPrayed our love wasn't vain\nWho was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?\n\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you\n\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you"}
