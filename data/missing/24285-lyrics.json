This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk, check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover\nShhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas\nNo brake pads, no such thing as last\nUh, uh\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)\n\nThere they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow\nNuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow\nFuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no\nHe ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nThey been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before\nBashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it\nPayback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,\nWhen I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?\nI'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)"}
