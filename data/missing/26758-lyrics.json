A traitor?\nAin't got your back?\nAre we not friends?\nWhat's up with that?\n\nSo I'm a misfit\nSo I'm a flirt\nI broke your heart?\nI made you hurt?\n\nThe past is past\nForgive, forget\nThe truth is...\nYou ain't seen nothing yet!\n\nMirror, mirror on the wall\nWho's the baddest of them all?\nWelcome to my wicked world, wicked world\n\nI'm rotten to the core, core\nRotten to the core\nI'm rotten to the core, core\nWho could ask for more?\nI'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door\nI'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the\nI'm rotten to the core"}
