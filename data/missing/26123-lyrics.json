Christ-like\nNigga I ain't psychic\nI know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it\nAnd France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements\nBut you might need a hand to enhance your performance\nConsider this a kilogram of encouragement\nTeach you how to sneak it past the enforcement\nAnd when you get it through in a manner so cool\nRemember to give a little nod to the old school\nWassup...\n\nGive me your old school love right now\nI'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want\nAnd give me that old school love right now\nYou know that only you and me alone...\n\nAs long as I'm here\nAs long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now\n\nAs long as I'm here\nAs long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now"}
