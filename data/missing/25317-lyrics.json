Yo\nAt the table with the family, havin' dinner\nBlackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker\nThen I took a look to see before it activates the ringer\nCame to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter\nThen I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger\nSippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla\nEven though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla\nBieber hit me back and said, \"Let's make it hot up in the winter.\"\nI said, \"Cool.\" Ya know Imma deliver\nLet's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger\nBefore we work I gotta get this off\nSee the other family members and drop gifts off\nThen I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how\nYou know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now\nPeople everywhere and all our Twitter followers\n\"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! \"\n\nJustin\nMary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum\nThe ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum\nI played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nI played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, pa pum pum, pa pum pum\n\nIf you wanna give, it's the time of year\nJB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare\nIt's crazy how some people say, say they don't care\nWhen there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair\nIt's about time for you to act merrily\nIt's about time for you to give to charity\nRarely do people even wanna help at all\n'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls\nNot thinking there's a family out hungry and cold\nWishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold\nSo I think some of you need to act bold\nGive a can to a drive, let's change the globe\n\nGlobe globe globe globe globe\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it"}
