I watched, I let it burn\nI threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs\nI crashed my car into the bridge\n\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care\n\nI got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone\nI crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn\nI threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs\nI crashed my car into the bridge\n\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care\n\nYou're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way\nYou want me down on Earth, but I am up in space\nYou're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch\nYou're from the Seventies, but I'm a Nineties bitch\n\nI love it!\nI love it!\n\nI got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone\nI crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn\nI threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs\nI crashed my car into the bridge\n\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care, I love it, I love it\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care\n\nYou're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way\nYou want me down on Earth, but I am up in space\nYou're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch\nYou're from the Seventies, but I'm a Nineties bitch\n\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care, I love it, I love it\nI don't care, I love it\nI don't care, I love it, I love it\nI don't care\nI love it"}
