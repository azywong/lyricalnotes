You get no love\n\nEminem\nIt's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now\n\nLil Wayne\n(Yeah)\n\nEminem\nYou kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't\n(Don't hurt me)\n\nLil Wayne\nThat's right (Don't hurt me)\nAnd I don't need you (No more)\nDon't want to see you (No more)\nHuh\n\nEminem\nBitch you get no (No love)\n\nYou showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground\nBut what comes around goes around (Yeah)\nAnd I don't need you (Don't hurt me)\n\nLil Wayne\nThat's right (You don't hurt me)\nAnd I don't need you (No more)\nDon't want to see you (No more)\n\nEminem\nHah, bitch you get\n(No love, no love, no love, no love)\nHah, bitch you get\n(No love, no love, no love)\n\nLil Wayne\nAnd I don't need you (No more)\n\nEminem\nBitch you get no (Love, love)"}
