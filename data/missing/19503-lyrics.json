Don't cry...\n'Cause you still be loved\nDon't cry\nDon't cry tonight\nOh...\n\nMy baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby\n...Ba da ba ba da da...\n\nMy baby my baby my my baby my baby my baby my baby mymy baby my baby my baby\n...Oh... yeyeyeyeiah... yeyeyeyeiah...\n\nMy baby...\n\nYou'll still be loved by me"}
