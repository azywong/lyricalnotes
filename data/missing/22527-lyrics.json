On the grill of my lowrider\nGuns on both sides, right above the gold wires\nI'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song\nAnd really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter\nTen G's'll take your daughter out of Air Forces\nBelieve you me homey, I know all about losses\nI'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious\nOne phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy\nI stay strapped like car seats, been banging\nSince my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys\nThat's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five\nI'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's\nTold Banks when I met him I'mma ride\nAnd if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide\nI ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died\nNow I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on\nSee how time fly?\n\n50 Cent\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\n(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)\n\nFrom the beginning to the end, losers lose\nWinners win this is real we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain\nEnough of me nigga now listen to Game\n\nThe Game:\nUsed to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench\nNow I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense\nMy moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent\nAnd she got a red bow on that brand new Benz\nWaiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range\nThinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes\nWhen there's kids starving\nPac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage\nI wanna know \"What's Going On\" like I hear Marvin\nNo schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins\nWhenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted\nI think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?\nI love you ma\n\n50 Cent\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\n(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)"}
