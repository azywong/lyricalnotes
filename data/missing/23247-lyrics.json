Don't call, don't come by\nAin't no use don't ask me why\nYou'll never change\nThere'll be no more crying in the rain\nOh...\nI'm over it...\n\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over (I'm sorry)\nMovin' on and it's my time\nYou never were a friend of mine\nHurt at first, a little bit\nBut now I'm so over, so over it...\nI'm so over it...\nI'm over it...\n\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over (I'm sorry)\nMovin' on and it's my time\nYou never were a friend of mine\nHurt at first, a little bit\nBut now I'm so over, so over it"}
