That's seldom.\nThis box better than the box he was held in.\n\nI'm Momma Dee in that order.\nI call him \"Daddy\" like daughters.\nHe like it when I get drunk,\nBut I like it when he be sober.\n\nThat's top of the topper.\nI never fuck with beginners.\nI let him play with my pussy.\nThen lick it off of his fingers. I'm in the zone.\n\nThey holler at me, but it's you, you.\nThis ain't high school.\nMe and my crew,\nWe can slide through.\n\nGive it to you whenever you want.\nWhip it wherever you want.\nBaby, it's yours!\nAnywhere! Everywhere!\n\nBaby, it's your world!\nAin't it?\nBaby, it's your world!\nAin't it?\n\nShe got a nigga at home. And one on the side.\nBest friend is a dyke.\nThey fucked around a few times.\nHer and her momma alike, so all they do is fight.\n\nI tell her, \"Make me some money.\"\nShe tells me make me a wife.\nI tell her, \"Bitch, you crazy.\nFucks wrong with you?\"\n\nAnd excuse my French,\nBut I'm a long kisser.\nAnd then she tries to tells me\nI'm the only one that's hitting.\n\nAnd I say, \"What about them niggas?\"\nShe say, \"What about them niggas?\"\n\"You're right. What you doing tonight?\nPut on something tight. Don't judge me. I get life.\"\n\nShe loves me like a brother,\nBut fucks me like a husband.\nPussy like an oven.\nToo hot to put my tongue in.\n\nAll I had to do was rub it-\nThe genie out the bottle.\nPussy's so wet,\nI'm a need goggles.\n\nShe tells me that it's mine.\nI tell her, \"Stop lying.\"\nMine and who elses?\"\nShe say, \"Worry 'bout yourself, Lil Tune.\"\n\nThey holler at me, but it's you, you.\nThis ain't high school.\nMe and my crew,\nWe can slide through.\n\nGive it to you whenever you want.\nWhip it wherever you want.\nBaby, it's yours!\nAnywhere! Everywhere!\n\nBaby, it's your world!\nAin't it?\nBaby, it's your world!\nAin't it?\n\nI know you want it, boy.\nI see you trying.\nJust keep on pushing.\nI'm a let you slide in.\n\nJust close your eyes\nAnd this horizon.\nIt's ready. Come get you some.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."}
