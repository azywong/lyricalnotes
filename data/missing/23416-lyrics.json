Hey! Make some noise!\nHey! Hey yeah!\n\nYou want to be known\nYou want to be heard\nYou know you are beautiful\nYou have so much to give\nSome change you wanna live\nSo shout it out and let it show\n\nYou have a diamond inside of your heart\nA light that shines bright as the stars\nDon't be afraid to be all that you are\nYou'll be fine\n\nDon't let anyone tell you\nThat you're not strong enough\nDon't give up\nThere's nothing wrong with just being yourself\nThat's more than enough\nSo come on and raise your voice\nSpeak your mind and make some noise, and sing\nHey! Hey! Make some noise!\nHey! Hey yeah!\n\nYou can't just sit back and watch the world change\nIt matters what you've got to say\nThere's no one else who can stand in your place\nSo come on, it's never too late\n\nMaybe it's your time to lift off and fly\nYou won't know if you never try\n\nDon't let anyone tell you\nThat you're not strong enough\nDon't give up\nThere's nothing wrong with just being yourself\nThat's more than enough\nSo come on and raise your voice\nSpeak your mind and make some noise, and sing\nHey! Hey! Make some noise!\nHey! Hey yeah!\nHey! Hey! Make some noise!\nSpeak your mind and make some noise, and sing\n\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nMake some noise\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nMake some noise\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nMake some noise\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nHey, yeah\nMake some noise"}
