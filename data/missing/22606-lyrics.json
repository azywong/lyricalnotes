What sets me free?\nDo you pull me up just to push me down again?\n\nPeel me from the skin, tear me from the rind\nDoes it make you happy now?\nTear meat from the bone, tear me from myself\nAre you feeling happy now?\n\nPeel me from the skin, tear me from the rind\nDoes it make you happy now?\nTear meat from the bone, tear me from myself\nAre you feeling happy now?\n\nDoes it make you happy?\nAre you feeling happy?\nAre you fucking happy\nNow that I'm lost, left with nothing?\n\nDoes it make you happy?\nAre you feeling happy?\nAre you fucking happy\nNow that I'm lost, left with nothing?"}
