I'm high\nI said, oh what a night, oh what a night\nYeah she a bad bitch, all jokes aside\n\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror\n\nChop one, chop two, chop that ass down\nChop that ass down, chop chop that ass down\nAll I want you to do is just drop that ass down\nDrop drop that ass down, now look back at it\n\nWhistling Dixie\nMiddle school, I was getting head on a ten speed\nJiggalo blood line, pimpin' hereditary\nBlack on 28's, it remind of February\nBet you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary\nDead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery\nI am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry\nFill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary\nMy vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'\nI've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'\nSo I closed the curtains on the 62\nHer ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move\nChain hang to my ding-a-ling\nChain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling\nTo do a threesome you gotta intervene\nHer legs so sexy when I'm in-between\n\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror\n\nShe do it like she do it in the mirror\nBe cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears\nShe speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears\nI'm looking for the baddest one here\nI tell her like, do that there, do that there\nYou gotta stretch it out, girl move that there\nShe bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there\nLike hut one, hut two, girl who back there?\nWho back there? I'm back there\nI could take a step back and sip my cognac there\nPicture perfect body, that's a Kodak there\nNow make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there\nI'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night\nThe roof is on fire, so what? I'm high\nI'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night\nThat's a bad bitch, all jokes aside\n\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror"}
