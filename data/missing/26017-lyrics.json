Oh... Oh...\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n\nWhen I was young, they told me, they said\nMake your bed, you lie in that bed\nA King can only rein 'till instead\nThere comes that day, it's off with his head\n\nThe night gets darkest right before dawn\nWhat don't kill you makes you more strong\nYou'll have my mercy, then when you're gone\n\nThe nights go on\nWaiting for a light that never comes\nI chase the sun\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n\nOh... Oh... Oh...\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n\nAnd I told them; nah you don't know me\nLightning above and a fire below me\nYou can not catch me, can not hold me\nYou can not stop, much less control me\n\nWhen it rains, it pours\nWhen the floodgates open, brace your shores\nThat pressure don't care, it breaks your doors\nSay it's all you can take, better take some more\n\nOh... Oh... Oh...\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n\nThe nights go on\nWaiting for a light that never comes\nI chase the sun\nWaiting for a light that never comes\n\nOh... Oh... Oh...\nWaiting for a light that never comes"}
