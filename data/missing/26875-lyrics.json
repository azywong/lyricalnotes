Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nTrying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nSometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head, I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\n\nYou give to me\nEverything, anything that I could dream\nAnd at least that's what it seems\nCould it be I don't know what's good for me?\n\nI'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful\nInstead of hollow\nSugar on your lips, it's hard to kill\nJagged like a pill, so hard to swallow\n\nAm I in love with you? Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nTrying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nSometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head, I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\n\nI'm sinking faster and faster\nBetween heaven and disaster\nSorry if I made you feel like\nI'm standing on the borderline\n\nAm I in love with you? Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nTrying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nSometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head, I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?"}
