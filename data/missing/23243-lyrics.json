Shadows And Synyster Gates","spotify_id":"4f6AE8OrLG66gds6A6epWd","lyrics":"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA\nThe footsteps that were next to me\nHave gone their separate ways\nI've seen enough now to know that beautiful things\nDon't always stay that way\nI've done enough now to know this beautiful place\nIsn't everything they say\n\nI heard that evil comes disguised\nLike a city of angels, I'm walkin' towards the light\n\nBaptized in the river\nI've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered\nIn the city I was a sinner\nI've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer\nLike the Prodigal Son, I was out on my own\nNow I'm tryin' to find my way back home\nBaptized in the river, I'm delivered, I'm delivered\n\nYou're from a small town, you're gonna grow up fast\nUnderneath these lights\nDown in Hollywood on the boulevard\nThe dead come back to life\nTo the praying Mother, the worried Father\nLet your children go\nIf they come back, they'll come home stronger\nAnd if they don't you'll know\n\nThey say that evil comes disguised\nLike a city of angels, I'm walkin' towards the light\n\nBaptized in the river\nI've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered\nIn the city I was a sinner\nI've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer\nLike the Prodigal Son, I was out on my own\nNow I'm tryin' to find my way back home\nBaptized in the river, I'm delivered\nI'm delivered\n\nBaptized in the river (On my own)\nI wanna be delivered\nBaptized in the river (On my own)\nI wanna be delivered\n\nOn my own\nOn my own\n\nBaptized in the river (On my own)\nI wanna be delivered\nBaptized in the river (On my own)\nI wanna be delivered\nBaptized in the river (On my own)\nI wanna be delivered\n\nI confess I'm a sinner\nI've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered"}
