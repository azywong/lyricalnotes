It is a friend of mine\n(Who is it?) Is it my brother?\n(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now\n(Who is it?) I can't take this stuff no more\n\nI am the damned, I am the dead\nI am the agony inside the dying head\nThis is injustice, woe unto thee\nI pray this punishment would have mercy on me\n\nAnd she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one\nWe made our vow to live love so true\nIt seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained\nI need to find the truth\nBut, see, what will I do?\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune\nStill I cry alone at night\nDon't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday\nAnd she didn't leave a letter\nShe just upped and ran away\n\n(Who is it?) It is a friend of mine\n(Who is it?) Is it my brother?\n(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now\n(Who is it?) I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely\n\nHee, Hee\nHee, Hee\n\nspoken:\nDon't try to make me,\nDon't try to make me crazy\nI never wanted this\nIt just won't stop\nDon't bother me\nDon't bother me\n\n(Who is it?) It is a friend of mine\n(Who is it?) To me, I'm bothered\n(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now\n(Who is it?) (Oww!) I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee)\nAnd it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune\nStill I cry alone at night\nDon't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself\nAnd the reason why she left me\nDid she find in someone else?\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)\nAnd it doesn't seem right (Da, Da, Da-rat)\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat)\nStill I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never)\nDon't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday\nAnd she didn't leave a letter\nShe just upped and ran away (You can really see I'm lonely)\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter,\nAnd it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune\nStill I cry alone at night (Da, Da, Da, Da)\nDon't you judge of my composure, (Don't be)\n'Cause I'm lying to myself (Don't be, don't be judgin')\nAnd the reason why she left me (Don't you, don't you)\nDid she find in someone else? (Keep begging 'cause I'm lonely)\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)\nAnd it doesn't seem right\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat)\nStill I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never)\nDon't you judge of my composure, (Don't be judgin')\n'Cause I'm bothered everyday (Don't be)\n(Don't be) And she didn't leave a letter\nShe just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely)\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee)\nAnd it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune\nStill I cry alone at night\nDon't you judge of my composure, (She don't, she don't phone me)\n'Cause I'm bothered everyday (She gone and did it)\nAnd she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't matter)\nShe just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)\nAnd it doesn't seem right (You just did it)\n'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-da)\nStill I cry alone at night (Da-da, Da-da, Da)\nDon't you judge of my composure, (Hee)\n(Hee) 'Cause I'm lying to myself\nAnd the reason why she left me\nDid she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)"}
