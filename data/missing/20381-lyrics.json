I'm a rapophile\n\nIf you want to battle, you're in denial\nComing from Uranus to check my style\nGo ahead, put my rhymes on trial\nCast you off into exile\n\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n\nJazz and Awol that's our team\nStep inside the party, disrupt the whole scene\nWhen it comes to beats, well I'm a fiend\nI like my sugar with coffee and cream\n\nWell I got to keep it going, keep it going full steam\nToo sweet to be sour, too nice to be mean\nWell on the tough guy style- I'm not too keen\nTo try to change the world- I will plot and scheme\n\nMario C likes to keep it clean (clean!)\nGonna shine like a sunbeam (beam!)\nKeep on rapping 'cause that's my dream (dream!)\nA from Moe Dee for sticking to themes\n\nWhen it comes to envy, y'all is green\nJealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine!)\nAnother dimension new galaxy\nIntergalactic planetary\n\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n\nWe're from the family tree of old school hip hop\nKick off your shoes and relax your socks\nThe rhymes will spread just like a pox\n'Cause the music is live like an electric shock\n\nI am known to do the Wop (Wop!)\nAlso known for the Flintstone Flop (Flop!)\nTammy D getting biz on the crop (crop!)\nBeastie Boys known to let the beat...mmm 'DROP'!\n\nNow when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop\nIf my rap's soup, my beats is stock\nStep from the table when I start to chop\nI'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock\n\nIf you try to knock me you'll get mocked\nI'll stir fry you in my wok\nYour knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop\nLike a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock\n\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\nAnother dimension\n\nDo it"}
