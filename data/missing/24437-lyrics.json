Everybody take it off\n\nThere's a place downtown\nWhere the freaks all come around\nIt's a hole in the wall\nIt's a dirty free-for-all\nAnd they turn me on\nWhen they take it off\n(When they take it off)\nEverybody take it off\n\nThere's a place I know\nIf you're looking for a show\nWhere they go hardcore\nAnd there's glitter on the floor\nAnd they turn me on\nWhen they take it off\n(When they take it off)\nEverybody take it off"}
