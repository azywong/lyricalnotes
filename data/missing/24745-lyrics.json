Man...\nUh... damn... cold world\nI never thought I'd see that day that you're my old girl\nNow I'm stuck here hollering at old girl\nGot one, Got two three four girls\nShotgun in the drop made her right\nHut one Hut two told them niggas take a hike\nThen it's on to the next on, on to the next one\nHard to move on when you always regret one\n(Verse 1 - Miguel)\nI wonder sometimes, I wondered if I was wrong\nTrying to do right by you got me here\nNow all I am is alone\n\n(Bridge - Miguel)\n'Cause her eyes, and those hips and that (ass)\nDon't compare, at all, no\nAnd at best all they do is distract me\nBut now deep down when I face it\n\nAll I want is you\nAll I want is you... now\nAll I want is you now\nNow that you're gone, gone, gone\n\n\n(Verse 2 - Miguel)\n'Cause being your friend is killing me softly\nI hear voices\nWonder where I went wrong\nIt was my fault\nAnd the wrong time, I wonder so often\nRegret gets exhaustin'\n\n(Bridge - Miguel)\n'Cause her eyes, and those hips and that\nDon't compare, at all to you\nAnd at best all they do is distract me\nBut now deep down when I face it\n\n\n(Verse 3 - Miguel)\n'Cause they don't smile or smell like you\n'Cause they don't make me laugh or even cook like you\n'Cause they don't photograph nah they don't sex like you\nLet face it\nI can't replace it\nThat's why All I want is you\n\n(Verse 2 - J Cole)\nI hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal\nTrying to celebrate my Independence Day Will Smith\nBaby gurl who I'm kidding\nStill sick Real shit\nAll my new bitches seem to get old real quick\nCould it be you everything these plain bitches couldn't be\nIs it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be\nLost in the Player way sorta get old to me\nGot me on layaway, Girl you gotta a hold on me\nI say I'm wrong, You say come again\nDamn said I was wrong look don't rub it in\nI got a lot on my mind\nGot a flock full of dimes\nLike a line full of hoes, Look how they coming in\nJust saying\nYou don't wanna have me then somebody will\nI'm playing\nWeight on my chest like I body build\nI'm praying\nYou ain't content with trying to do your thang\nHey come back baby boomerang\n\nNow that you're gone I want you back"}
