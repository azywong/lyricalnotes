So what we smoke weed.\nWe're just having fun. We don't care who sees.\nSo what we go out. That's how it's supposed to be.\nLiving young and wild and free.\n\nWiz Khalifa:\nUh, uh huh. So what I keep 'em rolled up.\nSaggin' my pants not caring what I show. Keep it real with my niggas.\nKeep it player for the hoes. And look clean don't it?\nWashed it the other day, watch how you lean on it,\nGive me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers.\nAnd smoke them hoes down till they stingers,\nYou a class clown and if I skip for the day.\nI'm with you bitch smokin' grade A.\n\nSnoop Dogg:\nYeah, uh you know what? It's like I'm 17 again. Peach fuzz on my face.\nLookin', on the case, tryna find a hella taste.\nOh my God, I'm on the chase.\nChevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy.\nRelevant, sellin' it, dippin' away.\nTime keep slippin' away, zip in the safe, flippin' for pay.\nTippin' like I'm drippin' in paint.\nUp front four blunts, like \"Khalifa put the weed in a J.\"\n\nBruno Mars:\nSo what we get drunk. So what we smoke weed.\nWe're just having fun. We don't care who sees.\nSo what we go out. That's how it's supposed to be.\nLiving young and wild and free.\n\nWiz Khalifa:\nAnd I don't even care 'cause if me and my team in there.\nThere's gonna be some weed in the air. Tell 'em Mac.\n\nSnoop Dogg:\nBlowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'.\nWhen I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up.\n\nWiz Khalifa:\nThat's how it should be done.\nSoon as you thinkin' you're down.\nFind how to turn things around.\nNow things are lookin' up.\n\nSnoop Dogg:\nFrom the ground up, pound up,\nThis Taylor Gang.\nSo turn my sound up and mount up.\nAnd do my thang.\n\nWiz Khalifa:\nNow I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'.\nLike I'm on my own and I could probably own a buildin'.\nGot my own car, no job, no children.\nHad a science project, me and Mac killed it.\n\nSnoop Dogg:\nT-H-C, M-A-C,\nD-E-V, H-D-3, high as me.\nThis is us, we gon' fuss.\nAnd we gon' fight and we gon' roll and live off life.\n\nBruno Mars:\nSo what we get drunk. So what we smoke weed.\nWe're just having fun. We don't care who sees.\nSo what we go out. That's how it's supposed to be.\nLiving young and wild and free.\n\nWiz Khalifa:\nYeah, roll one, smoke one.\nWhen you live like this you're supposed to party.\nRoll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun.\nSo we just, roll one, smoke one.\nWhen you live like this you're supposed to party.\nRoll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun.\n\nBruno Mars:\nSo what we get drunk. So what we smoke weed.\nWe're just having fun. We don't care who sees.\nSo what we go out. That's how it's supposed to be.\nLiving young and wild and free.\n\nSnoop Dogg:\nFun...\nWe don't care who sees.\nWe don't care who sees.\nThat's how it's supposed to be.\nLiving young and wild and free."}
