(You can achieve)\nWhen you believe, somehow you will, you will when you believe\n\nThey don't always happen when you ask\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fears\nOhh, but when you're blinded by your pain\nCan't see your way clear through the rain\nA small, but still resilient voice says hope is very near \n\nThere can be miracles\nMiracles\nWhen you believe\nBoy, when you believe, ohh\nThough hope is frail, it's hard...\nHard to kill, yeah\n\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve? \nYou can achieve, ohh\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\nSomehow, somehow, somehow\n\nSomehow you will\nI know, I know, know\nYou will when you believe\nWhen you believe...\n\nOhh, you will when you...\nYou will when you believe\nJust believe\nYou will, you will\nJust believe\nYou will when you believe"}
