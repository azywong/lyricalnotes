I just can't figure it out\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out\nWhat now? Whoa, what now?\n\nI found the one, he changed my life\nBut was it me that changed\nAnd he just happened to come at the right time\nI'm supposed to be in love\nBut I'm numb again\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like\nIt's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror\nWhatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me\nAnd I just wanna scream\n\nWhat now? I just can't figure it out\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out\nWhat now? Please tell me\nWhat now?\n\nThere's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all\nThe more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone\n'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions\nI can't even get the emotions to come out\nDry as a bone, but I just wanna shout\n\nWhat now? I just can't figure it out\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)\nWhat now? Somebody tell me\nWhat now?\n\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know ow ow why\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know ow ow why\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know ow ow why\n\nSo what now?"}
