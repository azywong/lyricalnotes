That's right, sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\nJust when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy\nYou try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy\nDon't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do?\nSo now I'm back\nTo makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on\nTryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'\nI'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close\nTo packin up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost\nTell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin control\nMy heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave\nWhen we conspire to conceive, and now\nYou gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'\nThat's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'\nNever no more will you see me, this is the end\nCause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucka for love\n... Damn, sucka for love... sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\nNow he left you with scars\nTears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit and run relationship\nIt use to be love, happieness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you a happy home, when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost\nTrapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it, you told me\nDon't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure\nMake a decision 'cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh\nI wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness\nBut I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\nKnow you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\n... I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up"}
