Yeah, yeah, yeah...\n\nWhen everything's goin' wrong\nDon't worry, it won't last for long\nYeah, it's all gonna come around\nDon't go let it get you down\nYou gotta keep on holding on\n\nIt's bout as bad as it could be\nSeems everybody's buggin' me\nLike nothing wants to go my way - it just ain't been my day\nNothin's comin' easily\n\nUp, up, up - can only go up from here\nUp, up, up - up where the clouds gonna clear\nUp, up, up - there's no way but up from here\n\nOh - I'm going up\nI'm going up\nI'm going up, up, up\nI'm going up\nOh... Yeah, yeah, yeah..."}
