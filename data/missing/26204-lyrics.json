Too aggressive!?\n\nFeel his blessings wash away my sins\nI'm sanctified and, I have been born again\nNow I proclaim, hallowed be thy name\nOh\n\nAll I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch\nPlus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage\nGroupies in the lobby they just tryna get established\nGod, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status\n\nKeys to my success, I get new keys and new address\nBitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress\nFelatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best\nMajor coke figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh\nSoldiers all in Al-Qaeda, new Mercades for cadets\nBalmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest\nDouble M, that be the Army, better yet the Navy\nBaby seen me in that rave, wanna have my baby\nAll I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch\nNow I want two hundred and menage in my palace\nWalkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance\nSomewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice\nRims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish\nTill I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish\nWhen we fucked again, she said \"That was just some foul shit\"\nI walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence\n\nThere's a few million angels movin' around me\nI just worship thee, for all he's done for me\nIt's a new day, I have been born again\nI've been born again, I've been born again\nIn His spirit, and His name\nI'm sanctified!\nLord I testify\nHe's right by my side\nI believe it be\nHis word is so clear to me\nYeah, yeah"}
