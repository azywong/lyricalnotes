Did you do something new?\nWell you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?\nYou, the more famous person you come through\nAnd the sexy lady next to you, you come too\nAnd then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me\nI'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe\nToo much of a newcomer and too uncool\nLike Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well\nThough I need a holiday like lady who sung blue\nGo back what ever you did you undo\nHeavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are what they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear, the camera's here\nAnd the microphones and they wanna know\n\nLupe Fiasco\nAnd you better wear your shades\nThe spotlights here can burn holes through the stage\nDown through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid\nAnd out through China nearly misses air liners\nMagnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer\nRicochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze\nNow that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade\nWe want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay\nLike the governor called and he told him to wait\nUn-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage\nThe audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise\nThey want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are that they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on and they want a show\n\nLupe Fiasco\nSo chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away\n'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days\nMe and security ain't getting along\nAnd when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone\nSo just take me home where the mood is mellow\nAnd the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow\nAnd the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker\nEverybody gets a nice autographed picture\nOne for you and one for your sister\nWho had to work tonight but is an avid listener\nEvery songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback\nAll the reviewers say you need to go and see that\nAnd everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased\nThen they all take the stage and start performing for me\nLike ha ha ha ha ha...\nHa ha ha ha ha... ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are what they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear, the camera's here\nAnd the microphones and they wanna know\nIf you are that they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on and they want a show"}
