What happened to her hair? Ha ha ha ha ha\nDat dad a dat da (4x) Dad a ooh\n\nLittle girl with the press and curl\nAge eight I got a Jheri curl\nThirteen I got a relaxer\nI was a source of so much laughter\nAt fifteen when it all broke off\nEighteen and went all natural\nFebruary two thousand and two\nI went and did\nWhat I had to do\nBecause it was time to change my life\nTo become the women that I am inside\nNinety-seven dreadlock all gone\nI looked in the mirror\nFor the first time and saw that HEY...\n\nI am not my hair\nI am not this skin\nI am not your expectations no no\nI am not my hair\nI ma not this skin\nI am a soul that lives within\n\n(Talking:)\nWhat'd she do to her hair? I don't know it look crazy\nI like it. I might do that.\nUmm I wouldn't go that far. I know ... ha ha ha ha\n\nGood hair means curls and waves\nBad hair means you look like a slave\nAt the turn of the century\nIts time for us to redefine who we be\nYou can shave it off\nLike a South African beauty\nOr get in on lock\nLike Bob Marley\nYou can rock it straight\nLike Oprah Winfrey\nIf it's not what's on your head\nIt's what's underneath and say HEY...\n\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nDoes the way I wear my hair make me a better person?\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nDoes the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Ooh\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nDoes the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nI am expressing my creativity...\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\nBreast Cancer and Chemotherapy\nTook away her crown and glory\nShe promised God if she was to survive\nShe would enjoy everyday of her life ooh\nOn national television\nHer diamond eyes are sparkling\nBald headed like a full moon shining\nSinging out to the whole wide world like HEY...\n\n(Ad lib)\nIf I wanna shave it close\nOr if I wanna rock locks\nThat don't take a bit away\nFrom the soul that I got\nDat da da dat da (4x)\nIf I wanna where it braided\nAll down my back\nI don't see what wrong with that\nDat da da dat da (4x)\n\n(Talking:)\nIs that India.Arie?\nOoh look she cut her hair!\nI like that, its kinda PHAT\nI don't know if I could do it.\nBut it looks sharp, it looks nice on her\nShe got a nice shaped head\nShe got an apple head\nI know right?\nIt's perfect."}
