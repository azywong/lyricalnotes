Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce\n\nOnce again nothin' jumpin' up in yo place,\nSick of your berry buzzin' all in my face,\nWay too much to tolerate,\nTime to roll,\nY'all know I gots to migrate.\n\nSpeed dial connecting me to Rae-Rae (Hey)\nClick in Shawntae and Mae-Mae (Hey)\nTreat it as a holiday,\n'Cause he's a wrap,\nY'all know I had to migrate.\n\nSee I'm on my way home,\nCause my jeans, yeah they fit,\nBut it might benefit\nMe to throw something on,\nTo feature my hips,\nAccentuate my ****\nAnd steal the show.\n\nSoon as we walk through the door,\nFellas be grabbin' at us like yo,\nTryin' to get us going off the Patron,\nWe sippin' Grigio... slow.\n\nIf your neck and your wrist coordinate,\nHair braided or faded okay,\nWe can move this back to my place,\nIt's time to migrate.\n\nFrom my car into the club we migrate,\nFrom the bar to V.I.P. we migrate,\nFrom the party to the after party, migrate,\nAfter party to hotel, migrate.\n\nAs we proceed getting buzzed,\nThe envious ones,\nHatin' but they can't take they eyes off us,\nBut we don't see none of that,\nThey playin' my jam,\nAnd the floor is packed,\nSo y'all need to migrate up out the door.\n\nWe clickin' glasses,\nCompliments of the club,\nRaise they status,\nSo you know they show us love,\nEverywhere we go,\nThey gon' flock,\nThem boys migrate to where it's hot.\n(It's hot, it's hot)\n\nSoon as we walk through the door,\nFellas be grabbin' at us like yo,\nTryin' to get us going off the Patron,\nWe sippin' Grigio... slow.\n\nIf you're inked up, thuggin'\nThat's what I like,\nFace body and Lamborghini outside,\nObviously boy you're qualified,\nOtherwise, migrate.\n\nFrom my car into the club we migrate,\nFrom the bar to V.I.P. we migrate,\nFrom the party to the after party, migrate,\nAfter party to hotel, migrate.\n\nT-Pain Rap\nThis is where it begins\nAnd ends at the very same time,\nT-Pain the main man of the hour,\nGot a flow that'll flex yo tire,\nGot stacks plus I'm back with Mariah.\n\nBut I gotta migrate to bar,\nFrom the bar to the flo',\nFrom the flo' to the car,\nFrom the car to the crib,\nThen back to the club,\nWe can migrate it all night,\nAnd mini coupe sittin' on dubs.\n\nWhatcha waitin' on,\nI can't stand in one place,\nI need that Patron and I,\nHate when I don't get it my way,\nSo don't wait for me to buy drinks,\nOr you gon' dehydrate,\nIt's time to migrate.\n\nSoon as I'm walkin' through the door,\nThey know I'm from the 8-5-0,\nI need three bottles of that Patron,\nI can make the Chevrolet grease up slow,\nIf your ... and your ... coordinate,\nTell it to me like it ain't OK,\nWe can move this back to my place,\nShawty best believe, it's time to migrate.\n\nSoon as we walk through the door,\nFellas be grabbin' at us like yo,\nTryin' to get us going off the Patron,\nWe sippin' Grigio... slow.\n\nIf you're inked up, thuggin'\nThat's what I like,\nFace body and Lamborghini outside,\nObviously boy you're qualified,\nOtherwise, Migrate.\n(Bye)\n\nKeep it movin... Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce\nKeep it movin... Bounce"}
