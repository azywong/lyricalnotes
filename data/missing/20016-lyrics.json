Who you wanna be huggin?\nDippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, wha!\nYou work more body than Jane Fonda,\nPhysical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness\nUnder pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya\nCougar by the side for ya, right hand high for ya\nBecause of you, I'm inheritin' trillions,\nBuryin' billions, Bentley Coupe millions\nPlayin' good samaritan, in the sheridan,\nCrack the Dom Pi's and Rim B's, you better hurry in\nWho's gone love you like I do? Huh? Wha?\nWho's gone treat you like I do? Huh? Wha?\nMary Blige, Lil Kim, hah-hah\nQueen Bees, ah-hah, that's me\nThat's right, Mary J, Lil K ...\n\nWho's gonna make you feel the way I do?\nNobody, nobody\nWho's gonna make you feel the way I do?\nNobody, nobody"}
