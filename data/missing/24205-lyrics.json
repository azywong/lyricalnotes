(down, down)\nBaby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)\nEven if the sky is falling down\n\nJust let it be\nCome on and bring your body next to me\nI'll take you away\nTurn this place into our private getaway\n\nSo leave it behind\n'Cause we have a night to get away\nSo come on and fly with me\nAs we make our great escape\nSo why don't we run away?\n\nSo baby, don't worry, you are my only\nYou won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down\nYou'll be my only, no need to worry\nBaby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)\nBaby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)\nEven if the sky is falling down\n\nLil Wayne\nDown like she supposed to be, she gets down low for me\nDown like her temperature, 'cause to me she zero degrees\nShe cold, like overfreeze, I got that girl from overseas\nNow she's my Miss America, now can I be her soldier, please\n\nI'm fighting for this girl on a battlefield of love\nDon't it look like baby cupid sent his arrows from above\nDon't you ever leave the side of me\nIndefinitely, not probably\nAnd honestly I'm down like the economy, yeah\n\nJay Sean\nSo baby, don't worry, you are my only\nYou won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down\nYou'll be my only, no need to worry\nBaby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)\nBaby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)\nEven if the sky is falling down"}
