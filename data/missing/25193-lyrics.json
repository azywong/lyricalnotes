I... I'm under and over it\nI... I... I'm under and over it\n\nYou can be me and I will be you\nYou can live just like a star\nI'll take my sanity; you take the fame\nI'm under it, over it all\nI'm under and over it\nI'm under it, over it all\nI'm under and over it\n\nI... I... I'm under and over it\nI... I... I'm under and over it"}
