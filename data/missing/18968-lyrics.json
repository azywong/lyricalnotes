Eliot\n\nMaybe if I could do a play-by-playback\nI could change the test results that I will get back\nI've watched the summer evenings pass by\nI've heard the rattle in my bronchi....\n\nSomeday I'll have a disappearing hairline\nSomeday I'll wear pyjamas in the daytime\n\nAfternoons will be measured out\nMeasured out, measured with\nCoffeespoons and T.S. Eliot\n\nAfternoons will be measured out\nMeasured out, measured with\nCoffeespoons and T.S. Eliot"}
