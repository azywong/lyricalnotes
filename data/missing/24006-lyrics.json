I'm talking to you\nAcross the water across the deep blue ocean\nUnder the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying\nBoy I hear you in my dreams\nI feel your whisper across the sea\nI keep you with me in my heart\nYou make it easier when life gets hard\n\nLucky I'm in love with my best friend\nLucky to have been where I have been\nLucky to be coming home again\n\nThey don't know how long it takes\nWaiting for a love like this\nEvery time we say goodbye\nI wish we had one more kiss\nI wait for you I promise you I will\n\nLucky I'm in love with my best friend\nLucky to have been where I have been\nLucky to be coming home again\nLucky we're in love in every way\nLucky to have stayed where we have stayed\nLucky to be coming home someday\n\nAnd so I'm sailing through the sea\nTo an island where we'll meet\nYou'll hear the music, fill the air\nI'll put a flower in your hair\nAnd though the breeze is through the trees\nMove so pretty you're all I see\nAs the world keeps spinning round\nYou hold me right here right now\n\nLucky I'm in love with my best friend\nLucky to have been where I have been\nLucky to be coming home again\nLucky we're in love every way\nLucky to have stayed where we have stayed\nLucky to be coming home someday"}
