(yeah)\nWe're paying with love tonight\n\nIt's not about the money, money, money\nWe don't need your money, money, money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\nAin't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching\nAin't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\n(Okay!)\nWe need to take it back in time\nWhen music made us all unite\nAnd it wasn't low blows and video hoes\nAm I the only one gettin' tired?\n\nWhy is everybody so obsessed?\nMoney can't buy us happiness\nCan we all slow down and enjoy right now?\nGuarantee we'll be feelin' all right\n\nEverybody look to the left, (to the left)\nEverybody look to the right, (to the right)\nCan you feel that?
