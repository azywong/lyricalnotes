Love had moved on\nLeft me alone thinking of...\n\nYou... There was never any other\nYou... and I were created to be true\n\nIsn't it Love that keeps us breathing\nIsn't it love we're sent here for\nWasn't that love that we were feeling\n(That was something baby)\n\nDeep in our soul... Deeper than we know\nKeeping me holding out for\n\nYou... There was never any question\nYou'll be forever on my mind\n\nYou and I, we were meant to be together\nTrue hearts in a world where love is dyin'\n\nAnd I might as well have been dyin' when\nWe were apart\nWhen you came back I felt the beating of my heart\n\nYou... There was never any question\nYou'll be forever on my mind\nYou and I, we were meant to be together\nYou... and only you\n\nIt was you... only you\nYou... Always you"}
