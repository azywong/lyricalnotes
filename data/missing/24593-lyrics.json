(To shame...)\n\nRachel:\nAnd still I dream she'll come to me\nThat we will live the years together\nBut there are dreams that cannot be\nAnd there are storms we cannot weather\n\nBoth:\nI had a dream my life would be\nSo different from this hell I'm living\nSo different now from what it seemed\nNow life has killed the dream I dreamed"}
