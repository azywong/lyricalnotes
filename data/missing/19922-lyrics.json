Yeah, you can dig it\nWhere you on your way to?\nUp to the ave, we heard it was kinda cool\nNo, I was just up on the ave myself, man\nWasn't nothin' happening up there\nWhat? Wasn't no foxes?\nThere was a few running around\nThat's cool\nBut you the man, you da man\nAll right, all right\n\nI'm the man today\nCan't nobody tell me nothin'\nGot a hold on life\nI'm takin' each day, by day\nBeing strong, know just where I'm going to\nAs I get higher and higher\nDreams grow, visions flow by\nThis is as good as it gets\nAs I take another hit, suga\nI can't stop, I won't stop\n\n1 - 'Cause I'm too cool (too cool)\nAnd what they say is true\nOh, I'm full of smoke\n'Cause I'm too cool (too cool)\nAnd what they say is true\nOh, I'm full of smoke\n\n2 - Watching my life go down\nWatching my life go down\nWatching my life go down\nWatching my life go down\n\nAnd all the day time just passes by me slowly\nBut I'm all right, you'll see\nFaces and places catching different cases\nTrue runners it's glorified\nSame situation, nothin' ever changes\nJust being a bonified hustler\nHustler, baby\nFrom day to night\nBusiness is as good as it gets\nAs I take another hit, honey\nI won't stop, I won't stop\n\nI'm the man today\nCan't tell me 'cause I'm feeling\n\nRepeat 2 until fade"}
