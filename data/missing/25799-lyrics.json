Or our last kiss?\nI used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test\nYou be fucking that nigga like you was fucking me?\nHa, fuck that nigga, he can't fuck with me\nI'm Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back\nBut any given night, I'd still pop that ass like a Prozac\nGirl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla\nAnd every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles\nAnd I know you still love me and I know ya still for me\nThat's why we still fucking, 'cause she don't put it down like you\n\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you\nGirl you working with the killer\nAin't nobody fucking with ya\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you\n\nLove being 'round mine, no downtime, still nothing else even matters\nCan't even walk slow through that mall, 'cause paparazzi running after\nBaby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster\nWhether them lights on or them lights off, like I'm sleeping with the clapper\nSaid she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter\nHow I'm sexing her, making likes of hers, no longer be a factor\nPlus her and I already know, you done turn them all to desperate\nClimb with the former rather ladder, you already know which one I'd rather\nCum on\n\nI done put another in your space\nDamn if they do, it's been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you\nGirl you working with the killer\nAin't nobody fucking with ya\nShe don't put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don't put it down like you"}
