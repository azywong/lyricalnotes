I does what I do you\n(Do it!)\nI fake the roof off of soft suckers\nSuper smackin... macking ...full effect mike check one two\nI'm a reign... rain forever\nRain like bad weather... reign like whoever never\nYou can't bite my style\nCause my style ain't a style\nThat is a style\nSo I can go buck wild\nBetcha figure you got more funk for flow\nIt ain't so\nFlava in Ya Ear letcha know\nNow I'm about a second, from the Hook duk\nStrap ya rap book\nBefore you get ya wet style shook\n\nCan I get down\nGet down\nGet on down\nCan I get down\n\nThe Mack's like a superintendent\nBurning MCs leaves a foul scent\nSee I'm like what ya call... king a yes y'all\nMy style wreck shit... I mean real shit\nShit's thick... I come with the ammo\nThe real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin'\nI wake great the lets warm up the hot plate\nI'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate\nMy rap loves to alienate\nShake ya ass to the stake\nYou sunk by domniate\nSee I ain't scared of you muthafuckas\nTo me ya all suckers 'cause I make the ruckus\nDon't try to buckus we roll with the cuf\nNo cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth\nI pound on the ground when I get down\nSo let me get down... let me get down\n\nTo leap a tall building\nCrush the earth-a-phone\nBut I'm sayin' ain't no fair when MCs roam\nThe mic now in the right hands\nCause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans\nMore pep than the peppa that's in ya peppa shaka\nRuff earthquaker... couldn't take me if ya mama make ya\nI back up the funk that I bring\nWith unknown to mad slang\nWith bigger bite than the double-bang\nI ain't met boot to hand\nIf ya testin in ya lesson\nGot me dressin for ya funeral session\nMan... It won't even matter no more\nCraig in 94' just won the war\nMy style definite to take ya over\nHave ya sittin' look over in a four door Chevy Nova\n(Why yi yi)\nI figure it's a slaughter\nIn the world of colins (?)\nYa shit ain't nothing but a quarter\nThe name of the track is Get Down\nSo let me Get Down and pound other MCs in the ground"}
