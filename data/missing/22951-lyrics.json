What ya gonna do?)\nTell me why we're standing here\nThe moment's passion's all so clear\nYou've got my mind blown\nAnd baby, I'm ready to go\n\nBut uh\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin', say somethin'\nIf it's worth your while\n\nSay somethin' good to me\nHey, hey, hey\nHey, hey\nIf it's worth your while\nDo something good to me\n\n(Let's make it)\nHot as you can stand it\nSomethin' like volcanic\nYou know it seems organic\n\nJust like the stars and planets\nYeah, we are\nSo what you gonna do?\n(So what ya gonna do? What ya gonna do?)\n\nTell me why we're still in here\nThere's nothing for us to fear\nI could tell with my eyes closed\nNow baby, I'm ready to go\n\nBut uh\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin', say somethin'\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin' good to me\n\nHey, hey, hey\nHey, hey\nIf it's worth your while\nDo something good to me\n\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin', say somethin'\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin' good to me, baby\n\nHey, hey, hey\nHey, hey\nIf it's worth your while\nDo something good to me\n\nEvery time I fall though\nWant me to speak on the word or two\nIt's the D-O-double-G\nAnd I do it so lovingly\nDiggin' this track by the Neptunes\nBaby girl, follow me to the rest room\n\nNow get buck wild\nShh, don't make a sound\nI'll take you, lay you down\nMake your body go 'round and 'round\nDo you want me to\n\nDon't say you won't\nI know you do\nMost girls play shy\nIt won't hurt until you give it a try\nI know you like my smile\nDig my style, big bow-wow\n\nBut uh\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin', say somethin'\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin' good to me\n\nHey, hey, hey\nHey, hey\nIf it's worth your while\nDo something good to me\n\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin', say somethin'\nIf it's worth your while\nSay somethin' good to me\n\nHey, hey, hey\nHey, hey\nIf it's worth your while\nDo something good to me"}
