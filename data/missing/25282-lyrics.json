'Cause we like to party!\n\nYour touch is driving me crazy - I can't explain the way I feel;\nTop down, with the radio on, and the night belongs to us - Just hold me close, don't let me go...\n\nSo in love - I don't care what they say!\nI don't curr if they talkin' tomorrow...\n'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,\nMusic knockin' till the morning light, 'cause we like to party!\n\nAndre 3000:\nSet the scene: 3000 degrees;\nI ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me...\nI got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese;\nFuck wit' me, baby - I make it milk till it drip down yo' knees...\nSpit this shit fo' rillo... brain Brillo;\nKiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old...\nNever thought that we could become someone else's hero;\nMan... we were just in the food court, eating our gyros...\nYesterday, that's the way - every single mornin', I try to pray;\nGrandmama 'n' nem, they never forgot - nothin' else really mean nothin' to me...\nI ain't studyin' the beat... Talkin' to me?\nGirl, why you fuckin' wit' me? Move on, ain't nuttin' to see!\nSh... always sung this song - I'm the raw, off the rip;\n'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men,\nAnd that they fell in love with rap - black like havin' your cousin back,\nBlue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah...\n\nBeyonc&#xE9;:\nSo in love - I'll give it all away;\nJust don't tell nobody tomorrow...\n'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,\nMusic knockin' till the morning light...
