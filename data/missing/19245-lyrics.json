Featuring Babyface","spotify_id":"4mKbb9uvBMlVvOUv8fdBt8","lyrics":"Don't even like to think about it\nI don't know what I'd do without it\nI only know that I live and breathe for your love\nBaby you came to me\nIn my time of need\nWhen I needed you, you were there for me\nBaby the love from you is what got me through\nIt's because of you, I was able to\nGive my heart again, you gave me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\n\nI thought I'd never love again\nI thought my life was over and\nI didn't want to face or even see another day\nSuddenly from no where, baby you appeared\nYou dried my tears, you cared for me\nMaybe your love for me, truly rescued me\nIt's because of you, I was able to\nFall in love again, you gave me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\n\nFor so long in my life, I wouldn't let love inside\nBut I swallowed my pride the day you arrived\nNow that you're by my side\nEverything is all right\nIt's because of you, I was able to\nGive my heart again, you gave me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know"}
