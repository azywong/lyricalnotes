Nah babe\nAll I want is you so what you tryna do?\n\nSo just wrap a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou use to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see\nYou should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me\nYou probably go insane with a nigga like me\nLet's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me\nAnd I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me\nSo don't come looking for love\n\nUntil the morning we can freak but baby girl you gotta know, know, know\nWe can rubble in these sheets but after this you gotta go, go, go\nDon't take it personal\nWhen it feel so good we cannot get emotional\nBut that is when you find out that it hurts the most\nSince then I've been like trust nobody, show no love\n\nSo just wrap a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou use to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see\nYou should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me\nYou probably go insane with a nigga like me\nLet's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me\nAnd I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me\nSo don't come looking for love"}
