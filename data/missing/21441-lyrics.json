Yeah\n\nNow in dreams we run\n\nShe spends her days up in the north park\nWatching the people as they pass\nAnd all she wants is just a little piece of this dream\nIs that too much to ask?\nWith a safe home and a warm bed on a quiet little street\nAll she wants is just that something to hold on to\nThat's all she needs, yeah\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that, what would I do?\nWhat would I do? Yeah\n\nI'm falling into this, in dreams we run away\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that, what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that, what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that, what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nFalling in\nI feel I am falling in to this again"}
