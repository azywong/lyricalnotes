I would.\nYes, I would for you\n\nMaybe you don't understand\nI don't understand it all myself\nBut there's a brother on my left and another on my right\nAnd in his pocket just like mine, he's got a photograph\nAnd they're waiting for him back home\n\nIt's weighing on my mind\nI'm not trying to be a hero\nI don't wanna die\nBut right now in this moment, you don't think twice\n\nI wonder, would I give my life?\nCould I make that sacrifice?\nIf it came down to it, could I take the bullet? I would.\nYes, I would.\n\nYou don't think about right, you don't think about wrong.\nYou just do what you gotta do to defend your own.\nAnd I'd do the same for you\nYes, I would.\n\nI would give my life. \nI would make that sacrifice.\n'Cause if it came down to it, could I take the bullet? I would.\nYes, I would do it for you.\nI'd do it for you.\n\nI'd take take the bullet\nYeah.\nYes, I would."}
