Dot (Yeah)\n\n(Ad Lib:)\nOoh Oh.\n\nspoken:\nThe dynamic duo.\n\nspoken:\nWow wow wow wow... it's what your body sayin'.\n\nChris Brown is in the building.\n\nThe young boy just turned 16\nAnd I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock\n\nKeep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,\nBut all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.\n\nSlow all the traffic down to a complete stop, cause you speaking that slang that I talk.\n\nThat sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all this jeans (?) may never see me.\n\nMomma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)\nYou be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)\nI know you like it how I lean in the lac,\nYou can be in the bac saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)\n\n(Repeat Song: 2x)"}
