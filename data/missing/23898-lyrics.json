You Ready?\nYeah!\n\nI get it in till the sunrise\nDoin' 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ah!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla gettin' money\nWhy do you wanna count my money?\nI'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see!\nI'm so paid\n\nI see police on the crooked I\nDoing a 100 on the Interstate 95\nMy shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die\nPushin' that motherfuckin' wood 'cause we certified\nGot a system that'll beat and knock your wall off\nGot a pump under my seat, the sawed-off\nGot a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off\nI'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all\nIt ain't too much to put a strain on me\nThat's the reason why I had to put the blame on me\nI rather have them dollar bills rain on me\nThen let them haters come and make the name of me\nThat's why...\n\nI get it in till the sunrise\nDoin' 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ah!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla gettin' money\nWhy do you wanna count my money?\nI'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see!\nI'm so paid\n\nI am the boss it only takes one call\nFor a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all\nGuess what I won't be taking that fall\nHomie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for (aha!)\nAin't that funny?\n'Cause niggas want war but ain't got money\n'Cause I've seen them all talking till they start gunnin'\nQuicker than Usain Bolt the fastest thing running\nYeah! Akon! Weezy!\nBlock oil holdin' down Jersey\nDevine making sure we gettin' it up front\nMy little brother Boo got that vision bake it!\n\nI get it in till the sunrise\nDoin' 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ah!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla gettin' money\nWhy do you wanna count my money?\nI'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see!\nI'm so paid\n\n(Lil Wayne - Verse 3)\nOh-oh,\nBig money Weezy\nWhite wife beater with the sig underneath it\nHow do I feel bitch I feel undefeated\nSnap my fingers disappear from the precinct\nYeah!\nI'm ballin' we ball out\nBall till we fall until the ball bounce\nI send some niggas with guns to y'all house\nOnly to find out you live in a doll house\nDamn!\nBut I thought you was tough though\nWe carry choppers on our necks\nCall it cut throat\nWe, bury cowards on the set that they come from\nWe, know magic turn\nWeed smoke to gun smoke\nWe, bomb first when we ride\nYou, in a hearse when you ride\nAy-yay\nI put my shoe down baby,\nAnd I'm holding down Young Mula baby!\nThat's why...\n\nI get it in till the sunrise\nDoin' 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ah!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla gettin' money\nWhy do you wanna count my money?\nI'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see!\nI'm so paid"}
