Oh! Oh! Oh!\n\nNow I'm begging for forgiveness\nI wanna make a difference even in the smallest way\nI'm only one person, but I can feel it working\nI believe in better days\nThat's why I pray\n\nSome stupid video posted as a joke, somebody's life gets ruined\nOut of everything we can create\nWhere is the cure to keep the sick from losing?\nBabies having babies 'cause their parents are always gone\nSomehow we have forgotten how to make a house a home\nHow to make a house a home\nOh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!\n\nI'm begging for forgiveness, I wanna make a difference\nEven in the smallest way\nI'm only one person, but I can feel it working\nI believe in better days\nThat's why I pray, yeah\nThat's why I pray, yeah\n\nThese demons from my past haunt me every night\nAnd I just can't get through it\nIf I could forget them on my own, I'll let go and just move on\nBut heaven knows I am only human\n\nAnd that's why I pray, yeah yeah\nThat's why I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray\n\nYes I'm begging for forgiveness (I'm begging for forgiveness)\nI just wanna make a difference (Just wanna make a difference)\nI believe (I believe) in better days\nThat's why I pray"}
