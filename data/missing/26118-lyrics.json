Oh brother, I will hear you call\nWhat if I lose it all? Oh sister, I will help you out\nOh, if the sky comes falling down, for you\nThere's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\n\nHey brother, there's an endless road to rediscover\nHey sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?\nOh, if the sky comes falling down, for you\nThere's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\n\nWhat if I'm far from home? Oh brother, I will hear you call\nWhat if I lose it all? Oh sister, I will help you out\nOh, if the sky comes falling down, for you\nThere's nothing in this world I wouldn't do"}
