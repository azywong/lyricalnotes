Every day, every day...\n\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...)\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...) Yeah...\n\nWith every single part of me (oh), my love for you is constantly (oh)\nForever and ever on repeat (oh), on repeat,\nAnd it won't stop... (Oh, oh, ooh, ooh...)\n\nI love when we pulling up to that beach, sand all in my feet,\nSun down, nobody 'round - that's one hell of a scene...\nYou rockin' my body, rock, rock the boat - Aaliyah - don't it sound familar?\n\n'Cause it feels like ah-ah, ay-ay, lookin' up into spa-ace;\nIt's just me and my ba-ae, and it feels so ama-azing,\nOh, ooh... all night, whoa...\n\nEvery little thing you do got me feeling some type of way; (Way...)\nWhen you gimme that thunder, you make my summer rain...\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh...)\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh...) Every day, every day...\n\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...)\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...) Yeah...\n\nWith every single part of me (oh), my love for you is constantly (oh)\nForever and ever on repeat (oh), on repeat,\nAnd it won't stop... (Oh, oh, ooh, ooh...)\n\nEvery day... every day, I can't breathe;\nYou take my breath away from me - Here's my heart, you got the key...\nPut that on eternity - I love you till infinity,\nInfinity, infinity, infinity, infinity...\n\nMy babe... my everything;\nAnd when I think about it, don't be making me wait, baby...\nIt won't ever stop, my heart won't skip a beat, baby,\nAnd it'll keep goin' on, goin' on, goin' on...\n\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...)\nAnd it won't stop... (Boom, boom, boom...) Yeah...\n\nWith every single part of me (oh), my love for you is constantly (oh)\nForever and ever on repeat (oh), on repeat,\nAnd it won't stop... (Oh, oh, ooh, ooh...)"}
