NO\nI was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW\nI was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. Whoa\nI've never been in hell like this\nSomebody wake me up!\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nI know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me\nBut I got to say\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nAnd I tried everything in my power to never ever say \"please come back to me\"\nBut I got to say\n\nThe crazy part was that he just kept going 'cause she was the only one that had noticed me\nStaring into the eyes that I will one day call my baby\nHow could I have fallen so in love with someone I've known for years\nAnd not even know that she'd be the one to reveal my worst fears\n\nIt was like a movie, too real to me, that just can't be my bride to be. NO\nI was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW\nI was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. Whoa\nI've never been in hell like this\nSomebody wake me up!\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nI know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me\nBut I got to say\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nAnd I tried everything in my power to never ever say \"please come back to me\"\nBut I got to say\n\nI didn't mean to do all those things to you\nTell me what to do to make it up to you\nI'll do everything, anything you want me to\n\nI didn't mean to do all those things to you\nTell me what to do to make it up to you\nI'll do everything, anything you want me to\n\nShould I leave, should I go, should I break apart / My Mama said you would break my heart\nI can't believe you a sleaze, you a slut, a ho, now you wanna have a change of heart\nDamn\nWho would have thought that you would have deceived me, love of my life, you my queen like Eve\nAnd you didn't even tell me you leavin', I had to hear about it on a scandal on TV\nNow who this man creapin' in the back door, 'bout to hit him with the FO FO FO\nI know you keep sayin' that you lovin' me so, but why the hell you crushin' him for\nGod damn now\nI don't care, that's what Ricky says, and if I catch him then this kid be dead.\nI don't play that Mami.\nNow back to the jets you go, I left your Reeboks by the front door.\nGet rocks\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nI know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me\nBut I got to say\n\nI don't care\nI just wanna be yours\nAnd I tried everything in my power to never ever say \"please come back to me\"\nBut I got to say\n\nSorry baby\nI didn't mean to hurt you\n\nI don't care\nThat's what Ricky says"}
