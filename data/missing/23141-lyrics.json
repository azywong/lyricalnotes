(nothing, no nothing)\nBaby, I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)\nI won't lose a wink of sleep, 'cause the truth of the matter is \nReplacing you is so easy\n\nTo the left, to the left\nTo the left, to the left, mmm\nTo the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left\nTo the left, to the left\nDon't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\nI could have another you in a minute\nMatter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\nI can have another you by tomorrow\nSo don't you ever for a second get to thinkin', baby, hey hey\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\n'Cause I could have another you in a minute\nMatter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby\n\nYou must not know 'bout me, nigga, pack all yo' bags, we finished\nYou must not know 'bout me, 'cause you made your bed, now lay in it\nI can have another you by tomorrow\nSo don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable"}
