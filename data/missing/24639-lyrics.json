I digress\nI confess you are the best thing in my life\nBut I'm afraid when I hear stories about husband and wife\nThere's no happy endings, no Henry Lee\nBut you are the greatest thing about me\n\nIf it's love\nAnd we decide that it's forever\nNo one else could do it better\nIf it's love\nAnd we're 2 birds of a feather\nThen the rest is just whatever\n\nAnd if I'm addicted to loving you\nAnd you're addicted to my love too\nWe can be them 2 birds of a feather\nThat flock together\n\nLove, love\nGot to have something to keep us together\nLove, love\nThat's enough for me\n\nTook a loan on the house I own\nCan't be a queen bee without a bee throne\nI wanna buy you everything except cologne\n'Cause it's poison\nWe can travel to Spain\nWhere the rain falls mainly on the plain\nSounds insane, 'cause it is\nWe can laugh, we can sing\nHave ten kids and give 'em everything\nHold our cell phones up in the air\nAnd just be glad that we made it here alive\nOn a spinning ball in the middle of space\nI love you from your toes to your face\n\nIf it's love\nAnd we decide that it's forever\nNo one else could do it better\nIf it's love\nAnd we're 2 birds of a feather\nThen the rest is just whatever\n\nAnd if I'm addicted to loving you\nAnd you're addicted to my love too\nWe can be them 2 birds of a feather\nThat flock together\n\nLove, love\nGot to have something to keep us together\nLove, love\nThat's enough for me\n\nYou can move in\nI won't ask where you been\n'Cause everybody has a past\nWhen we're older\nWe'll do it all over again\n\nWhen everybody else is getting out of bed\nI'm usually getting in it\nI'm not in it to win it\nI'm in it for you\n\nIf it's love\nAnd we're 2 birds of a feather\nThen the rest is just whatever\nAnd the rest is just whatever\nIf it's love\nAnd we decide that it's forever\nNo one else could do it better\n\nAnd if I'm addicted to loving you\nAnd you're addicted to my love too\nWe can be them 2 birds of a feather\nThat flock together\n\nLove, love\nGot to have something to keep us together\nLove, love\nGot to have something to keep us together\nLove, love\nThat's enough for me"}
