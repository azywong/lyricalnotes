While you be walkin'?\n\nFoot soldier catch you at the store's corner\nKeep me on your mind and don't slumber\nMan the minute you slip with those, that's your ass\n\nM O B B dunn, let's get it on dunn\nWith Bounty Killer, yo, it's like this dunn\nAiyyo cock that shit, pop that shit\nSqueeze off, let 'em know how real this is\n\nM O B B, D double E P with Bounty Killer\nNo other gun runners keep a round like this\nFrom Q U double E N S, my bomb borough, till the day of my death\nWhether in shit I been in, runnin' down the block\n\nSprayin' shots with the Lindon, listen\nWe all been through action, you know the last me blastin'\nThe last man standin, pack shit long than bare wake\nNeither the Jake nor the snakes gon' stop it\n\nYou know the Mobb lettin' off rockets\nGun burners spit like lungies, dummies\nStill nuttin' pop but the shells\nThese ain't words from hell these are slugs, something you feel\nA gun runner nigga for real nigga\n\nYo hear my gat blow, make you spit out crack the axle\nOf that brand new Six that you couldn't seem to whip\nEmpty the clip, make sure no friendly get hit\nWhile you layin bloodied up in the Six\n\nFlee the frontline, dismantle gat then bounce\nThen watch the twelve o'clock news and hear them shout you out\nPlug leak, slip rug right from under your feet\nYou runnin' the streets, you don't want no problems with us\nEveryday is like Fourth of July to us\n\nHenny in my cup beside the gat you'll find in my clutch\nInterfere with the plan and you will get touched\nLet the liquor talk for you and you will get touched\nFull fledge, like Ra let 'em know The Ledge\n\nWhile you slippin' off edge, your shorty's givin' me head\nCockin' 'em legs like guns when I'm cockin to spray\nPoppin' your way, sendin' shit that's hot your way"}
