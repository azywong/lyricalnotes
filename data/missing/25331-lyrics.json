How you feel? How you feel?\n25 sittin' on 25 mil\nI'm in the building and I'm feeling myself\nRest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay\n\nOkay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop\nMy team good, we don't really need a mascot\nTell Tune, \"Light one, pass it like a relay.\"\nYMCMB, you niggas more YMCA\n\nMe, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o\nShout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo\nWe got Santa Margherita by the liter\nShe know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her\n\nThat's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?\n'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill\nI mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will\nI can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?\n\nNow she want a photo, you already know though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?\n\nOne... time? Fuck one time\nI'm calling niggas out like the umpire\nSeven... grams in the blunt\nAlmost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt\n\nIt's Eastside, we in this bitch\nWish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch\nAnd if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch\nThat's my MO, add a B to that shit\n\nI'm fucked up, torn down\nI'm twisted: door knob\nTalk stupid? Off with your head!\nNigga money talks, and Mr. Ed\n\nI'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun\nEnergizer bunny\nFunny how honey ain't sweet like sugar\nAin't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers\n\nI tongue kiss her other tongue\nSkeet skeet skeet: water gun\nOh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi\n\nNow she want a photo, you already know, though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?\n\nReal nigga, what's up?\n\nNow she want a photo, you already know, though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?"}
