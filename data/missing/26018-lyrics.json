Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late\nHe got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day\"\nShe says... If life was a movie, then it wouldn't end like this\nLeft without a kiss\nStill, she smiles, the way she smiles, yeah\n\nShe's talking to angels, she's counting the stars\nMaking a wish on a passing car\nShe's dancing with strangers, she's falling apart\nWaiting for Superman to pick her up\nIn his arms, In his arms\nShe's waiting for Superman\n\nTo lift her up and take her anywhere\nShow her love and climbing through the air\nSave her now before it's too late tonight\nOh, like a speeding light\nAnd she smiles\n\nShe's talking to angels, she's counting the stars\nMaking a wish on a passing car\nShe's dancing with strangers, she's falling apart\nWaiting for Superman to pick her up\nIn his arms, In his arms\nShe's waiting for Superman\n\nTo lift her up and take her anywhere\nShow her love and climbing through the air\nSave her now before it's too late tonight\nShe's waiting for Superman"}
