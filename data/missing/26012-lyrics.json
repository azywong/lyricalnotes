Just a reflector\nThought you were praying to the resurrector\nTurns out it was just a reflector. Just a reflector\nThought you were praying to the resurrector\nTurns out it was just a reflector. Just a reflector\n\n(It&#x2019;s just a reflector) It&#x2019;s just a reflector\n(It&#x2019;s just a reflector) It&#x2019;s just a reflector\n\nJust a reflector\nJust a reflector\nJust a reflector\nMeet you on the other side"}
