What you want it to be\nLove is ... Heaven to the lonely\nShow me what you want me to do\nCause love is what I've got for you\n\nCan't live on promises\nWon't sleep with lies\nDon't understand the things you say\nTill I read 'em in your eyes\nGotta run on instinct, gotta go by feel\nGotta trust my senses\nTo know if it's for real\n\nLove is ... what you want it to be\nLove is ... heaven to the lonely\nShow me what you want me to do\nCause love is what I've got for you\nLove is..."}
