Define Ambition for me?)\n\nMy ambition to win, just to get me some ends\nHelp me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz\nI saw momma praying as she wait on results\nIt was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch\nMy father was missing, War Lord Oliver North\nLife was diggin' me deeper, I kept on coming up short\nBreaking so many laws, waking up in the dark\nWho cut my power off? it's time to move that soft\nNot too many options when you coming from the projects\nSittin' in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper\nGirls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change\nAnd I doubt that ever change\nAmbition is priceless that's something that's in your veins\nAnd I doubt that ever change\nAmbition is my shit and I put that on my name\nAnd I doubt that ever change\n\nAmbition\nEasy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it\nThey gon love me for my Ambition\nEasy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it\nThey gon love me for my Ambition\nEasy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it\nLook, they gon love me for my ambition\nBeautiful music, painting pictures that be my visionf-\n\nWell wishers to my opposition\nYou probably cop a plea before you cop a prison\nI got nothing against them, they got fucking potential\nBut every nigga who can read gotta get his issue\nSubscribe, reside where all the lions and killers be\nAnd I ain't spend a minute up in the streets\nBut I'm limitless mentally, I'm lyrically MC\nLebron, I was heading 6 after 23\nAnd family is everything and money is less important\nLong as your mama love you, don't ever love a woman\nI got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings\nBut I got that green on my eyes\nAnd that ain't no Donnie Simpson\nI retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!\nThey play surface so slippery niggas can't even kick it\nY'all rambling, talking shit to these bitches\nYou know you real you don't say it\nYou know you real, we gon feel it\nRalph!\n\nBeautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision\nThey gon love me for my ambition\nEasy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it\nLook, they gon love me for my ambition\nBeautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision\nThey gon' love me for my ambition"}
