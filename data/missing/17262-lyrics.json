Just wait for you\nAll that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you\n\nFull of sorrow, your eyes are too wide and too new\nAll I know is these feelings I get when you're near\nKeep in mind, I can't give you love without fear\nYou're too young, I don't know what's keeping me here\n\nAll that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you\nAll that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you\n\nAll that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you\nAll that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you\nAll that I can do... ooh... ooh..."}
