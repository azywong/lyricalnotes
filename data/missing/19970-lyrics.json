Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards, my niggas is stone cold killas, peelas, dippin' out the limos and bitch, y'all just maintain, givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'. My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love, and the Biz follow all of my senses, pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders, Jesus sent me his roll and (?) soul but load a revolver, hold up, now, buck 'em all to Hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em. And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck, ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out. The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up. Hold up, and wait a minute. It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga.\n\nKrayzie:\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nKrayzie:\nWhat makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original? What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago. And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit. I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, and don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy. And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that, but a y'all fin to get stomped. Let 'em loose. And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh. Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way--fully automatic when we let 'em lay. \"Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface.\" Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect. Come on, now, put them to rest. What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress. I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me. It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak .\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nLayzie:\nAll I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most. I toast to them thugs. Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table. And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud. Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone, five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga, and it's war when you craft these Bones. We can get it on, and I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches. Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that. Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin' shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that? I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes, but we chosen. God done blessed us with His potion, pure devotion, freely spoken, baby. Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever, ridin' through the days of the stormy weather, remember: eternal, it means forever lastin'. #1 Assassin blastin'. Bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'. All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come\n. We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong.\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nWish:\nI see five killa realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go, true to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river, we the killas, and that's for sure. Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine, and when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time, and it's like that, you don't want that. Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like-- Wanna be like-- Nigga, we can't have that. Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps. Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'. Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down. Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad, 'cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a bodybag. Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with harmony, harmony.\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?"}
