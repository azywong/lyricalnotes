Are we talkin' teams?\nOh you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?\nLook at the smile on me, look at the owl on me\nI do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me\nSay she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you\nThis game is different, you only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you\nMan fuck 'em all, man we want it all\nDon't get too involved, we gon' knock you off\nAnd to top it all, I'm with all the dogs\nIt's a new season and we still breathin'\n\nAnd I got a really big team\nAnd they need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\nI got a really big team\nThey need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\n\nMan what a time, to be alive\nI'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died\nI run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers\nI'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers\nYou just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper\nNiggas be droppin' subliminals, they're just some jibber jabber\nWe take a Mellow Yellow then fill it with red forever-ever\nThese niggas is jealous, jealous, these niggas is scared, they tellin'-tellin'\nI fuck a check up on everything, I bought some ice when the feds came\nI bought that new Celine, I got some rings, I got racks like Serena\nAll of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina\nPluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus\nFresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners\nWho keepin' score 'cause these niggas, they losin'\n\n'Cause I got a really big team\nAnd they need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\n'Cause I got a really big team\nAnd they need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team"}
