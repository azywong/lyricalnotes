(x8)\n\nLuda!\nShe could go lower than I ever really thought she could\nFace down, ass up!\nThe top of your booty jiggling out your jeans\nBaby, pull your pants up\nI like it when I see you do it\nBetter than I've ever seen it done before\nA lot of women drop it to the ground\nBut how low can you go?\nLower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime\nNever would've imagined did not even in her right mind\nPractice in front of that mirror\nNow you doing it on the dance floor\nMad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)\nI may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do\nBut if you come to the crib\nThen I might show you girls a thang or two\nYeah, I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow\nBefore you make it big\nThere's just one thing that I gotta know\n\nHow low can you go? (x8)\nGo low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)\n\nI be like Nick-nac-paddywac\nOh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone\nHow many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home\nI could make me show stop\nSoon as you hear this flow pop\nFrom A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop\nPut the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini\nAnd if she really gettin' low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV\n'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel\nBut when it comes to chocolate\nI know that very well\nAsian persuasion\nNo discrimination\nI love how they seem to please us\nI wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces\n'Cause I think you a superstar\nWith a ass like that you gotta blow\nBefore you make it big\nWell there just one thing that I gotta know\n\nHow low can you go? (x8)\nGo low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)\n\nDrop it, hit it, dump it, split it\nDon't stop (Get it, get it)\nPut it on reverse just to back it up\nLet me put some Luda in it\nShow me what you workin wit\nI'll show you some of this bank roll\nYeah you a superstar there's just one thing I gotta know so\n\nHow low can you go? (x8)\nGo low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)"}
