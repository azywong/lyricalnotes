Give yourself a break\nLaugh about it and you'll see that\n\nLife's what you make it\nSo let's make it rock\nLife's what you make it\nSo come on\nEverybody now!\n\nWhy be sad, broken-hearted?\nThere's so much to do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nLife is hard or it's a party\nThe choice is up to you!\n\nWith a new attitude, everything can change\nMake it how you want it to be\nStaying sad, why do that? Give yourself a break\nI know you want to party with me\n\nLife's what you make it\nSo let's make it rock\nLife's what you make it\nSo come on\nEverybody now!\nLet's celebrate it\nJoin in everyone\nYou decide 'cause\nLife's what you make it!\n\nThings are lookin' up\nAny time you want\nAll ya gotta do is realize that\nIt's under your control\nSo let the good times rock and roll, hey\n\nLife's what you make it\nSo let's make it rock\nLife's what you make it\nSo come on\nEverybody now!\nLet's celebrate it\nJoin in everyone\nYou decide 'cause\nLife's what you make it!"}
