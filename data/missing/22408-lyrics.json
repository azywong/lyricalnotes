No chance\nNo matter the circumstance\nWhatever it takes girl, I'll swim to France\nCause your beauty's unmatched\nSuch a great catch\nUnconditional love, forever we are attached\nDeal with the drama, we can find our way back\nWith or without the Maybach\n\nHush baby, wanna let you know\nThis is how it's gonna go\nIf you wanna come and play\nGotta do it my way\nHush baby, don't talk so much\nJust wanna feel your touch\nEverything will be okay\nIf you do it my way (my way, my way)\nHush baby\n\nI can feel your pain\nLike we Siamese twins, connected by our brains\nWalkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain\nWant you in my life and nothing's gonna change\nGod willin', we still be doin' our thing\nWhen my six-pack's faded\nRaps outdated\nBut that's many years from now, so don't rush\nLittle mama, just hush\n\nHush baby, wanna let you know\nThis is how it's gonna go\nIf you wanna come and play\nGotta do it my way\nHush baby, don't talk so much\nJust wanna feel your touch\nEverything will be okay\nIf you do it my way (my way, my way)\nHush baby\n\nHush baby\nHush, hush darling\nHush baby, hush, hush\nDon't talk so much\nWanna feel your touch\n\nHush baby, hush\nHush baby, hush\n\nHush baby, wanna let you know"}
