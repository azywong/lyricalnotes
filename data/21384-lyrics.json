I don't know what it is\nBut everything about you... is so irresistible\n\nDon't you try and tell me that he's not my type\nTo hide what I feel inside\nWhen he makes me weak with desire\nI know that I supposed to make him wait\nLet him think I like the chase\nBut I can't stop fanning the fire\nI know I mean to say no\n\nBut he's irresistible\nUp close and personal\nNow inescapable\nI can hardly breathe\nMore than just physical\nDeeper the spiritual\nHis ways are powerful\nHe's irresistible to me\n(I... I can hardly breathe)\n\nDon't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right\nThat I should really say goodnight\nBut I just can't stop myself falling (falling)\nMaybe I'll tell him that I feel the same\nThat I don't want to play no game (no)\nCause when I feel his arms wrapped around me\nI know I mean to say no (I mean to say no)\n\nBut he's irresistible\nUp close and personal\nNow inescapable\nI can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)\nMore than just physical\nDeeper the spiritual (oh yeah)\nHis ways are powerful\nIrresistible to me\n\nCan't you see whenever he's close to me\nI really find it hard to breathe \nHe's so irresistible\nBaby you know... is more than just spiritual \nHis kisses are powerful\nHe's so irresistible (he's so irresistible)\n\nBut he's irresistible (yeah yeah)\nUp close and personal (oh yeah)\nNow inescapable\nI can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)\nMore than just physical (oh yeah)\nDeeper than spiritual\nHis ways are powerful\nIrresistible to me\n\nHe's irresistible\nUp close and personal (yeah)\nNow inescapable\nI can hardly breathe (irresistible to me)\nMore than just physical\nDeeper than spiritual\nHis ways are powerful\nIrresistible to me"}
