(Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah)\nHow far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)\n\n[Bridge]\nTu que estas en alto cielo\nEchame tu bendicion\n\n[Hook]\nCause I know there's a better place than this place I'm living\nHow far is heaven?\nSo I just got to have some faith and just keep on giving\nHow far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)\nHow far is heaven? (Cause I just got to know how far, yeah)\nHow far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)\nHow far is heaven? (Cause I just gotta know how far)\nI just want to know how far"}
