To make you cry this time?\nWell, I will be your comforter. I will make it right\nHe cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light\nCome in...\n\nI see he's hurt you again,\nWhen you're in pain I'm in pain\nThat's part of bein' a friend.\nBut this is a special case.\nI held my feelings back because of him\nAnd now I can see more than ever\nI made a big, big, big mistake.\n\nI don't mean to disregard your feelings\nBut i think that he's a fool.\nhe don't know how sensitive you are\nAnd baby, that just ain't cool.\n\nI'm just glad I could be here for you\nWhen you need a helping hand.\nBut deep inside my heart, from the start\nI know I shoud have been your man.\n\nLay down.\nAnd tell me what's on your mind.\nWhat exactly did he do?Tell me what he do...\nTo make you cry this time?

Please tell me, baby.\nAnd tell me what's on your mind  Tell me what's on your mind\nWhat exactly did he do? To make you cry this time\nWell, I'll be your comforter. I will make it alright\nHe cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your lig"}
