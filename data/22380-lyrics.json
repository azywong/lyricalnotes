Everything okay?\nShe hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind\n(spoken) What am I doing?\nHe knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line\nThey walked down to the beach and started drinking again\nJumped into the ocean for a dirty swim\n\nOne more margarita then we're falling in love\nOne more's never enough\n\nDon't bite off more than you can chew\nThere's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do\nJust remember when you let it all go\nWhat happens down in Mexico\nStays in Mexico\n\nOh Mexico\n\nWaiting at the bar at the terminal gate\nShe says 'Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane'\nHe said one more tequila for you climb on up\nShe said one more's never enough\n\nDon't bite off more than you can chew\nThere's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do\nJust remember when you let it all go\nWhat happens down in Mexico\nStays in Mexico\n\nStays in Mexico\nStays in Mexico\nStays in Mexico\nOh Mexico"}
