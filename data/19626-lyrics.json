AC-DC's?)\n\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nTwo turntables and a microphone\n\nWhere it's at!\nI got two turntables and a microphone\nWhere it's at!\nI got two turntables and a microphone\n\nOh, dear me. Make-out City's a two-horse town\n(girl [spoken]: \"That's beautiful, Dad.\")\n\n(Got my microphone....)\nThere's a destination a little up the road\nFrom the habitations and the towns we know\nA place we saw the lights turn low\nThe jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow\n\nPulling out jives and jamboree handouts\nTwo turntables and a microphone\nBottles and cans and just clap your hands \nAnd just clap your hands\n\nWhere it's at!\nI got two turntables and a microphone\nWhere it's at!\nI got two turntables and a microphone\n\nI got plastic on my mind\n(make it out, baby)\nyeah, yeah, yeah\nlet's make it out, baby\nyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n(scream)\ntelephone plastic baby\nahh, so good\noh, yeah\nlet's play good \now ow ow ow ow\n"}
