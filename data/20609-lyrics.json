Rhyme or crime, let's get it on\nMC's wanna eat me but it's Ramadan\nPeep what's on the arm, when it's ice it's ice\nWhen I'm right, I'm right, when you're wrong, you're wrong\nI'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze\nFlows all night like vintage Dom\nBeen this nice since umm, the first Prince bomb\nBefore \"The Artist Was Known As\" wit my grown ass\nHaters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past\nCelly on roam, full belly, first class\nAnd I don't play, I watch them pockets\nKnow y'all niggas go broke after you cop them watches\nSee you in the club, no bub' nigga pop it\nThen you wanna fuck, give it up nigga, not this\nMy coat is ostrich, flow is the hottest\nYou ain't got dough, you can't go with the Fox bitch\n\n[Hook]\nYou can catch me at the hot spot cause I Fox, I plots\nAt the bar y'all, all night, I pops\nIs it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it\nThis is our world, me and my girls\nYou can catch me at the hot spot, I Fox, I plots\nAt the bar y'all, all night, I pops\nIs it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it\nThis is our world, me and my girls\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo! Cats bustin out the six, cash flushin out the niggas\nPlatinum heart in half hangin 'tween the two tit-ties\nScheme on your team, lookin over graph pictures\nPick the finest, then I put it on the minors\nLove, after the club, meet me at the diner\nSo you can bring your boys, we got ten cars behind us\nOrder a steak, a glass of OJ to break-fast\nHop in the car and head straight up Eighth Ave\nThe night is young, I'm likin son\nEither he don't have one, or his wife is dumb\nHis whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb\nPull up my tights some, enticin him\nYou can handle the work, I'll play wit it\nTil he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it\nBitches in the club they, hated it\nCause I put my mack down then I, skated it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou can catch me at the Expo', Jacob Jav\nKnocking Jigga out the Navigator, layin back, I stay in that\nMe fallin off? Imagine that, it's not the case\nI'm sittin' on Top of the World like Brandy and Mase\nYou wanna, buy me a drink, nigga hand me a case\nBig ballin bitch, I want all of this shit\nSix AMG's with the spoiler kit\nChromes from the fac', phones front and back\nCoCo, flow, niggas is wantin that\nOut they vehicles, niggas is bumpin that\nI heard you wanna stop Fox, tell me how so\nI got that New York, to the Dirty South flow\nWhole album hot, even the outro\nThis time around I'm tryin to do about fo'\nThis is for my niggas and bitches who count dough\nAnd y'all in the club I make em bounce\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nHot spot (pause), bar y'all (pause)\nAlright (pause), our world (pause)\nHot spot (pause), bar y'all (pause)\nAlright (pause), our world (pause)"}
