(Yeah)\nYeah? (Talk to me!)\nYou want me to tell you something? (Uh huh)\nI know what you wanna hear\n\n[Refrain: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]\nI know you want me, baby, I think I want you too\n(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too\nI'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\nI wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl\nYou know you want me, baby, you know I want you too\nThey call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you\nI wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\n(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nThey call me Superman\nLeap tall hoes in a single bound\nI'm single now: got no ring on this finger now\nI'd never let another chick bring me down\nIn a relationship; save it, bitch!\nBabysit? You make me sick\nSuperman ain't savin' shit\nGirl, you can jump on Shady's dick\nStraight from the hip, cut to the chase\nI tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face\nPlay no games, say no names\nEver since I broke up with what's-her-face\nI'm a different man, kiss my ass\nKiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?\nKiss my dick, get my cash?\nI'd rather have you whip my ass\nDon't put out, I'll put you out\nWon't get out, I'll push you out\nPuss blew out, poppin' shit\nWouldn't piss on fire to put you out\nAm I too nice? Buy you ice?\nBitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life\nWhat, you tryin' to be my new wife?\nWhat, you Mariah? Fly through twice\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches, they come, they go\nSaturday through Sunday, Monday\nMonday through Sunday, yo\nMaybe I'll love you one day\nMaybe we'll someday grow\n'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\n‘Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nDon't get me wrong, I love these hoes\nIt's no secret, everybody knows\nYeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?\nThat's about as far as your buddy goes\nWe'll be friends, I'll call you again\nI'll chase you around every bar you attend\nNever know what kinda car I be in\nWe'll see how much you be partyin' then\nYou don't want that, neither do I\nI don't wanna flip when I see you with guys\nToo much pride, between you and I\nNot a jealous man, but females lie\nBut I guess that's just what sluts do\nHow could it ever be just us two?\nI'd never love you enough to trust you\nWe just met and I just fucked you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches, they come, they go\nSaturday through Sunday, Monday\nMonday through Sunday, yo\nMaybe I'll love you one day\nMaybe we'll someday grow\n'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\n‘Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\n\n[Refrain: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]\nI know you want me, baby, I think I want you too\n(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too\nI'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\nI wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl\nYou know you want me, baby, you know I want you too\nThey call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you\nI wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\n(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nFirst thing you say: (I'm not fazed\nI hang around big stars all day\nI don't see what the big deal is anyway\nYou're just plain old Marshall to me)\nOoh yeah, girl, run that game\n(Hailie Jade, I love that name\nLove that tattoo, what's that say?\n\"Rot In Pieces,\" uh, that's great)\nFirst off, you don't know Marshall\nAt all, so don't grow partial\nThat's ammo for my arsenal\nI'll slap you off that bar stool\nThere goes another lawsuit\nLeave handprints all across you\nGood Lordy, whoadie\nYou must be gone off that water bottle\nYou want what you can't have\nOoh girl, that's too damn bad\nDon't touch what you can't grab\nEnd up with two backhands\nPut anthrax on a Tampax\nAnd slap you 'til you can't stand\nGirl, you just blew your chance\nDon't mean to ruin your plans\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches, they come, they go\nSaturday through Sunday, Monday\nMonday through Sunday, yo\nMaybe I'll love you one day\nMaybe we'll someday grow\n'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\n‘Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\n\n[Refrain: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]\nI know you want me, baby, I think I want you too\n(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too\nI'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\nI wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl\nYou know you want me, baby, you know I want you too\nThey call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you\nI wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world\n(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\n‘Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman"}
