No one knows\nI realize, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement\nNumber one spot, now she found her a replacement\nI swear now I can't take it\nKnowin somebody's got my baby\nAnd now you ain't around, baby I can't think\nI shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring\nCause I can still feel it in the air\nSee her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair\nMy love of my life\nMy shorty, my wife\nShe left me, I'm tight\nCause I knew that it just ain't right\n\n[Hook]\nUhh, uhh, uhh\nI was thinkin 'bout her, thinkin 'bout me\nThinkin 'bout us, where we gon' be?\nOpened my eyes, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travel back, down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I be ridin man I swear I see her face at every turn\nTryin to get my Usher on but I can't let it +Burn+\nAnd I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for\nMy woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?\nDidn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback\nNow I'm in the club thinkin all about my baby\nHey, she was so easy to love\nBut wait, I guess that love wasn't enough\nI'm goin through it every time that I'm alone\nAnd now I'm missin, wishin she pick up the phone\nBut she made a decision that she wanted to move on\nCause I was wrong\n\n[Hook]\nUhh, uhh, uhh\nI was thinkin 'bout her, thinkin 'bout me\nThinkin 'bout us, where we gon' be?\nOpened my eyes, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travel back, down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything\nEverything (heyyy)\nSaid if you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything"}
