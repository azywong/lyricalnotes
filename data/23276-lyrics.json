(wanted more?)\nDon't you know there's so much more?\n\n(chorus)\nYou've got to keep your mind wide open\nAll the possibilities\nYou've got to live with your eyes open\nBelieve in what you see\n\n(bridge)\nTommorow's horizons,\nFull of suprises,\nDon't let them take\nYour dreams away\n\n(chorus)\nYou've got to keep your mind wide open\nAll the possibilities\nYou've got to live with your eyes open\nBelieve in what you see\n\nYou've got to keep your mind wide open\nAll the possibilities\nYou've got to live with your eyes open\nBelieve in what you see\n(You've got to keep your mind wide open)\nBelieve in what you see\n(You've got to live with your eyes open)\nBelieve in what you see"}
