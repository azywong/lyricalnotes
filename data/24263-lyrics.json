{"song_name":"(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To","artist_id":431262,"display_artist":"Weezer","spotify_id":"5VBuNc5ZzLxiZCFHpPPhLu","lyrics":"The moon was shinin' on the lake that night.\nThe Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right.\nThrough smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light.\nYou told me stories about your chickadees\nThey didn't like BB guns or stupid archery.\nThe jumbo lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free.\n\nThen the conversation stopped and I looked down at my feet.\nI was next to you and you were right there next to\nme.\nThen I said, Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\nSo make the move, cause I ain't got all night.?\n\nThe rest of the summer was the best we ever had.\nWe watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad.\nI took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your mom and dad.\nYour mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat\nmeat.\nI dug you so much I took some for the team.\nYour dad was silent. His eyes were fixed to what was on TV.\n\nThen the conversation stopped and I looked down at the ring.\nYour folks were next to you and you were right there next to me.\nThen I said, Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\nI swear it's true. Without you, my heart is blue.\nOoohwhoa Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\nSo make a move, cause I ain't got all night.?\n\nSo much pain may come our way.\nThere may come a day when we have nothing left to\nsay.\n\nWhen the conversation stops and we?re facing our\ndefeat.\nI'll be next to you and you?ll be right there next to me.\nThen I'll say, Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\nI swear it's true. Without you my heart is blue.\nOoohwhoa Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\nSo make a move, cause I ain't got all night.?"}
