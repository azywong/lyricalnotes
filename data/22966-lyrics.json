Oh oh oohh\n\nWith just a look, they shook \nAnd heavens bowed before him.\nSimply a look \nCan break, your heart.\n\nThe stars that pierce the sky; \nHe left them all behind.\nWe're left to wonder why \nHe left us all behind. \n\nChorus:\nHey, Miss Murder can I! Hey, Miss Murder can I!\nMake beauty stay if I, Take my life? Oh oh ooh\n\nOh... \n\nDreams of his crash, won't pass! \nOr how they all adored him.\nBeauty will last when spiraled down.\nThe stars that mystify; \nHe left them all behind.\nAnd how his children cry; \nHe left us all behind. \n\nChorus:\nHey, Miss Murder can I! Hey, Miss Murder can I!\nMake beauty stay if I, Take my life? Oh oh oohh\n\nWhat's the rift that twists \nwithin this furthest mystery? \nI would gladly bet my life upon it.\nAt the cost of love \nyour ray of light will fizzle out!\nWithout hope! Aaarrgg...\nWhen the empty sand just flowing through our\nempty skin! \n\nAnd we're searching for what we were promised. \nReaching for the cold and rain we never let\ngo; \nThey won't ever let us blow our filthy hands apart. \n\nChorus:\nHey, Miss Murder can I! Hey, Miss Murder can I!\nMake beauty stay if I, Take my life? ( x 2)"}
