Are you satisfied?\nWish I might, Wish I may\nYou wish your life away\nAre you pacified?\n\nAll the wants you waste\nAll the things you've chased\n\nThen it all crashes down\nAnd you break your crown\nAnd you point your finger, but there's no one around\nJust want one thing. just to play the King\nBut the castle crumbled and you're left with just a name\nWhere's your crown, King Nothing?\nWhere's your crown?\n\nHuh!\n\n(Spoken)\nWish I may, wish I might\nHave this wish, I wish tonight\nI want that star, I want it now\nI want it all and I don't care how\n\nCareful what you wish\nCareful what you say\nCareful what you wish you may regret it\nCareful what you wish you just might get it\n\nThen it all crashes down\nAnd you break your crown\nAnd you point your finger, but there's no one around\nJust want one thing, just to play the King\nBut the castle crumbled and you're left with just a name\nWhere's your crown, King Nothing?\nWhere's your crown?\n\nOh, You're just nothing\nWhere's your crown King Nothing?\nOh, you're just nothing\nAbsolutely nothing\nOff to never, never land\n"}
