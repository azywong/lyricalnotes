( Ohhh Ohhh )\nJust can't get through to you... ( Ohhh Ohhh )\nI Never gonna tell you nothing wrong...\nListen...\n\nIt's like whatever I say\nOoh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh\n\n[Verse 1:]\nNow, now she loved me, shawty I loved her\nUsed to jump up in the maybach and roll out\nUsed to care, she used to share\nThe love that she used to give me can't be found\nI lost my way, she said she'd stay\nAnd lately I've been sleeping with a ghost\nMy stock is down and out, \nI used to be worth my weight in gold\nThat was before a great depression kicked \nin and rocked us\nAnd that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us\nI told you to leave, but you lied to me\nWhen you said that, \nbaby no worries I promise to get us back\n\n[Chorus:]\nI know sorries, just wouldn't do it\nHer heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo\nBut it's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains... hey\nBut I keep climbing and hoping things would change\nAnd the sky turns grey, \nand the water from the rain washes progress away\nIt's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains...\nWhy just leave me, just leave me, be\nJust leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe ooh\n\n[Verse 2:]\nShe, she don't touch me, I don't touch her\nWe really even never say a word\nI really want to give her everything she deserves\nBut, the bag took away the curve\nShe thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, \nalways pissed, man I'm tired\nEvery kiss, bed I missed, \ngirl you know I'm trying\nYou never believe when I say, \nand I never believe it when you say\nI love you, and I shouldn't complain about it\nI should take it like a man and walk about it\nCause we will never be the same ooh\nI've been standing in gas, and you would be the flame\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nI know sorries, just wouldn't do it\nHer heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo\nBut it's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains... hey\nBut I keep climbing and hoping things would change\nAnd the sky turns grey, \nand the water from the rain washes progress away\nIt's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains...\nWhy just leave me, just leave me, be\nJust leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe ooh\n\n[Background singing]\nThis must be a slow death that I'm travelin on\nIt feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin on\nSee no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together \n(baby yea)\nAnd these hills that I'm travelin up\nShe ain't showin me love\nI'm down on my love\n\nOhhh\n\nI know sorries, just wouldn't do it\nHer heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo\nBut it's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains... hey\nBut I keep climbing and hoping things would change\nAnd the sky turns grey, \nand the water from the rain washes progress away\nIt's like moving mountains...\nIt's like moving mountains...\nWhy just leave me, just leave me, be\nJust leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe why you just leave me, just leave me\nBe ooh"}
