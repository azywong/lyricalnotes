Your sex is on fire\n\nDark of the alley, the breaking of day\nThe head while I'm driving, I'm driving\n\nSoft lips are open, knuckles are pale\nFeels like you're dying, you're dying\n\nYou... Your sex is on fire\nConsumed with what's to transpire\n\nHot as a fever, rattling bones\nI can just taste it, taste it\n\nIf it's not forever, if it's just tonight\nOh it's still the greatest, the greatest\n\nYou... Your sex is on fire\nYou... Your sex is on fire\nConsumed with what's to transpire\n\nAnd you... Your sex is on fire\nConsumed with what's to transpire"}
