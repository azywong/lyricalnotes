A piano, a guitar?\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal\nI don't think about it, I deposit every other zero\nThinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal\nDigging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you\nEveryday my logic get another dollar just to keep you\nIn the presence of your chico... Ah!\nI don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel\nIf I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you\nPet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all\nPick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all\nI rap, I black on track so rest assured\nMy rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God\n\n[Pre-hook Hook]\nWouldn't you know\nWe been hurt, been down before\nNigga, when our pride was low\nLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\"\nNigga, and we hate po-po\nWanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'\nNigga, I'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow\nBut we gon' be alright\n\n[Hook]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Bridge]\nI keep my head up high\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nLovin' me is complicated\nToo afraid, a lot of changes\nI'm alright and you're a favorite\nDark nights in my prayers\n\n[Outro]\nI remembered you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence, sometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screamin' in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self destruct\nthe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went runnin' for answers"}
