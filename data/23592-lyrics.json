I got a lot to say\nI notice your eyes are always glued to me\nKeeping them here and it makes no sense at all\n\nThey've taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYour little spies\nThey've taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYour little spies\nCrush... Crush.. Crush... Crush! Crush!\n2, 3, 4\n\nNothing compares to\nA quiet evening alone\nJust the one, two\nOf us, who's counting on?\nThat never happens\nI guess I'm dreaming again\nLet's be more than, this\n\nIf you wanna play it like a game\nWell come on, come on let's play\nCause I'd rather waste my life pretending\nThan have to forget you for one whole minute\n\nThey've taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYour little spies\nThey've taped over your mouth\nScribbled out the truth with their lies\nYour little spies\nCrush... Crush.. Crush... Crush! Crush!\n2, 3, 4\n\nNothing compares to\nA quiet evening alone\nJust the one, two\nOf us, who's counting on?\nThat never happens\nI guess I'm dreaming again\nLet's be more than, this now\n\nRock and roll baby\nDon't you know\nThat we're all alone now\nI need something to sing about\nRock and roll  (Hey) !\nDon't you know baby\nWe're all alone now\nI need something to sing about\nRock and roll  (Hey) !\nDon't you know baby\nWe're all alone now\nGimme something to sing about\n\nNothing compares to\nA quiet evening alone\nJust the one, two\nOf us, who's counting on?\nThat never happens\nI guess I'm dreaming again\nLet's be more than\n\nNothing compares to\nA quiet evening alone\nJust the one, two\nOf us, who's counting on?\nThat never happens\nI guess I'm dreaming again\nLet's be more than, more than this"}
