Beautiful stranger \n... Beautiful stranger \n  \nIf I’m smart then I’ll run away \nBut I’m not so I guess I’ll stay \nHaven’t you heard? \nI fell in love with a beautiful stranger \n  \nI looked into your face \nMy heart was dancing all over the place \nI’d like to change my point of view \nIf I could just forget about you \n  \nCHORUS 1 \n  \nI looked into your eyes \nAnd my world came tumbling down \nYou’re the devil in disguise \nThat’s why I’m singing this song to you \n  \nCHORUS 1 \n  \nI’ve paid for you with tears \nAnd swallowed all my pride \n  \nCHORUS 2"}
