I've had it up to here!\n\nThe moment that I step outside\nSo many reasons\nFor me to run and hide\nI can't do the little things\nI hold so dear\n'Cause it's all those little things\nThat I fear\n\n'Cause I'm just a girl,\nI'd rather not be\n'Cause they won't let me drive\nLate at night\nI'm just a girl,\nGuess I'm some kind of freak\n'Cause they all sit and stare\nWith their eyes\nI'm just a girl,\nTake a good look at me\nJust your typical prototype\nOh... I've had it up to here!\nOh... am I making myself clear?\n\nI'm just a girl\nI'm just a girl in the world...\nThat's all that you'll let me be!\n\nI'm just a girl, living in captivity\nYour rule of thumb\nMakes me worry some\nI'm just a girl, what's my destiny?\nWhat I've succumbed to\nIs making me numb\nI'm just a girl, my apologies\nWhat I've become, is so burdensome\nI'm just a girl, lucky me\nTwiddle-dum there's no comparison\n\nOh... I've had it up to!\nOh... I've had it up to!!\nOh... I've had it up to here. "}
