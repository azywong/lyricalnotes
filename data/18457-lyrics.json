Can I have them please?\"\n\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\" \"Son, I don't know when\nWe'll get together then\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\n\nI've long since retired, my son's moved away\nI called him up just the other day\n\"I'd like to see you, if you don't mind\nHe said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time\"\n\n\"You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu\nBut it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad\nIt's been sure nice talkin' to you\"\nAnd as I hung up the phone it occurred to me\nHe'd grown up just like me\nMy boy was just like me\n\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\" \"Son, I don't know when\nWe'll get together then\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\n\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\" \"Son, I don't know when\nWe'll get together then\nYou know we'll have a good time then\""}
