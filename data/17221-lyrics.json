Reid and Babyface\n\nThere comes a time in every man's life\nYou're gonna do wrong\nI made a mistake girl..Just let me..\nJust let me explain\n\nI can't believe it\nAlthough I did it\nI've never been that kinda man\nI must admit it\nI wasn't with it\nBut you were the best I've ever had\n\nRight now I'm going thru some changes\nI've always thought I was\nA faithful kind of man\nI never thought I would be tempted\nBaby you licked my lips\nAnd I said right now...right now\n\nIn the heat of the moment**\nBaby I lost my head. Lost my mind\nDidn't know what to do\nIn the heat of the moment\nBaby I fell in lust with you\n\nNow that I've done it\nOh how I want it\nBut I've got to be a stronger man\nI love my lady\nCan't lose my baby\nCause if she knew\nI'd lose everything I have\n\nDon't want to go thru no more changes\nFrom now on I promise I will be a better man\nBut here you are again temptin'\nBaby when you lick my lips. I said\nRight now, right now\n\nRepeat chorus**2x\n\nBaby Baby you've got to slow down\nFrom now on I promise I will be a better man\nNow...Now I know that you know\nThat we can't carry on like this\nGirl stop...just stop\nBaby when you kissed my lips, I said\nRight now...Right now\n\nRepeat chorus 3x"}
