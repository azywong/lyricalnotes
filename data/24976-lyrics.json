On a kiss,\nThought I'd save my breath for you.\nChoke! On a kiss,\nThought I'd save my breath for you.\n\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm hanging on you.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm pulling for you now.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming out of my head,\nInto the clear\nWhen you go, I come loose!\n\nThese premonitions got me crying up a storm.\nIn your condition this position does no harm.\n\nChoke! On a kiss,\nThought I'd save my breath for you.\nChoke! On a kiss,\nThought I'd save my breath for you.\n\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm hanging on you.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm pulling for you now.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming out of my head,\nInto the clear\nWhen you go, I come loose.\n\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm hanging on you.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming loose.\nI'm pulling for you now.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming through.\nAnd I'm calling on you.\nGimme some rope, I'm coming out of my head,\nInto the clear\nWhen you go, I come loose."}
