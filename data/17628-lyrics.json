No matter what it is, it's possible\nSay, anything is possible\n(Anything...) No matter what it is, it's possible\nSay, anything is possible\n(Anything...) No matter what it is, it's possible\nSay, anything is possible\n\nVERSE 2:\nMuch to my surprise I felt\nA warm, not cold vibe\nWhen he looked in my eyes\n(Oh yeah, it's possible)\nHis bad boy front not charm\nWas his disguise\nOh whoa whoa\n(Let me tell ya)\nHe read so much into me\nListened so attentively\nHe liked me, I rest my case\nWasn't just a pretty face\n\nBRIDGE:\nIf you set your mind\nYou can do anything you want\nNot every guy is a bad guy\nDon't stereotype\n'Cause this guy, he proved me wrong\n(Anything is possible...)\nHe taught me:\n\nAnything is possible\nJust put your mind to it\n\nIf you put your mind\nYou know you can do anything,\nAnything\n\nAnything is possible\nAnything is possible\nAnything is possible\nJust put your mind to it\nAnything is possible\nIf you put your mind to it\n"}
