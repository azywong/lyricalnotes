I know you cram to\n  understand\nwho i am. Damn, by the way can i please get this\n  dance\nlet's not freelance cause i'm just getting started,\nbelieve me that was nothing but a brown party. That's\non, going on and got it going on. Bob and ted's rated\nnumber one so flow on it and if you're in the house\npump your fist and say ho, ho, ho.\nTed bring me on back\nBring me on back, dance. There it is oow.\n\nChorus w/ bobby's adlibs\n"}
