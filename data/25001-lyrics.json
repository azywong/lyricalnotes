I wish I could run\nAway from this ship goin' under\nJust tryin' to help, hurt everyone else\nNow I feel the weight of the world is on my shoulders\n\nWhat can you do when your good isn't good enough\nAnd all that you touch tumbles down?\nCause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things\nI just wanna fix it somehow\nBut how many times will it take?\nOh, how many times will it take for me to get it right?\nTo get it right\n\nCan I start again with my faith shaken?\nCause I can't go back and undo this\nI just have to stay and face my mistakes\nBut if I get stronger and wiser, I'll get through this\n\nWhat can you do when your good isn't good enough\nAnd all that you touch tumbles down?\nCause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things\nI just wanna fix it somehow\nBut how many times will it take?\nOh, how many times will it take for me to get it right?\n\nSo I throw up my fist, throw a punch in the air\nAnd accept the truth that sometimes life isn't fair\nYeah, I'll send out a wish, yeah, I'll send up a prayer\nAnd finally someone will see how much I care\n\nWhat can you do when your good isn't good enough\nAnd all that you touch tumbles down?\nOh, my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things\nI just wanna fix it somehow\nBut how many times will it take?\nOh, how many times will it take to get it right?\nTo get it right"}
