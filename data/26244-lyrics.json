(Am I wrong?)\nFor thinking that we could be something for real?\n(Oh yeah yeah yeah)\nNow am I wrong?\nFor trying to reach the things that I can't see?\n(Oh yeah yeah yeah)\nBut that's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see\n\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right, right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right, right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right\n\nAm I wrong?\nFor thinking that we could be something for real?\nNow am I wrong?\nFor trying to reach the things that I can't see?\nBut that's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see\n\nSo am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor thinking that we could be something for real?\n(Oh yeah yeah yeah)\nNow am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor trying to reach the things that I can't see?\n(Oh yeah yeah yeah)\nBut that's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see"}
