Here it goes\n\nFree your mind\n\nI wear tight clothing, high heel shoes\nIt doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute (no, no, no)\nI like rap music, wear hip hop clothes\nThat doesn't mean that I'm a sellin' dope (no, no, no)\n\nOh my, forgive me for having straight hair\nIt doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs\nI might date another race or color\nIt doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nWhy, oh why must it be this way?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nBefore you can read me you got to learn how to see me\n\n(I said)\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\n\nSo I'm a sista\nBuy things with cash\nThat really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad (Oh)\n\nSo why dispute me and waste my time\nBecause you really think the price is high for me\nI can't look without being watched\nYou rang my buy before I made up my mind\n\nOh now attitude why even bother\nI can't change your mind, can't change my color\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nWhy, oh why must it be this way?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nBefore you can read me you got to learn how to see me\n\n(I said)\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\n\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\n\nFree your mind\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nWhy, oh why must it be this way?\nBefore you can read me you got to learn how to see me\n\n(I said)\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\n\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\nFree your mind and the rest will follow\nBe color-blind, don't be so shallow\n"}
