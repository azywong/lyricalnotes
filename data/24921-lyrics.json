They all go wild\nFor you and your denial\nThey’re watching you break down(Break Down)\nHate me all you want, I’ll be okay\nI’m half the world away\nI’m letting you go now (Go Now)\nYou’ve got sadness twisted up with jealousy\nYou show your fists to make them look like loyalty\nAnd I have seen what holding on can take away\nIf it’s the past you love then that’s where you can stay\nCan you hear the crowd? They all go wild\nFor you and your denial\nThey’re watching you break down (break down)\nHate me all you want, I’ll be okay\nI’m half the world away\nI’m letting you go now (go now)\nGo Now (go now)\nDesperation kills\nBut when it’s on your sleeve you wear it well\nUnderneath it all you’ll always have this war inside yourself\nI’m letting you go now (go now)\nCan you hear the crowd?\nThey all go wild\nFor you and your denial\nThey’re watching you break down (break down)\nHate me all you want, I’ll be okay\nI’m half the world away\nI’m letting you go now (go now)\nGo Now (go now)\nGo Now (go now)\nGo Now (go now)\n---\n."}
