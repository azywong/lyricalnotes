Mmm.\n\nSome guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease,\nTie my hands behind my back and, ooo, I'm in ecstasy.\nDon't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters,\nBefore I get too cranky, you better...\n\nChorus:\n\nLike hanky panky [hanky panky],\nNothing like a good spanky [good spanky].\nDon't take out your handkerchiefs,\nI don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.\nLike hanky panky [hanky panky],\nNothing like a good spanky [good spanky].\nDon't take out your handkerchiefs,\nI don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.\n\nOooo.\n\nPlease don't call a doctor, 'cause there's nothing wrong with me,\nI just like things a little rough and you better not disagree.\n'Cause I don't like a big softie, [no], I like someone mean and bossy,\nLet me speak to you frankly, you better...\n\n(chorus)\n\nOooo, yeah.\n\nSpoken:\n\nWhat about? Yeah. That's an interesting...\nOooo.\nMy bottom hurts just thinking about it.\n\n[She wants you to] Treat me like I'm a bad girl,\n[She needs you to] Even when I'm being good to you.\nI don't want you to thank me [Don't thank her], you better...\n\n(chorus)\n\n[Hanky panky] Oooh, yeah\n[Good spanky] Get the picture?\n[Don't wanna cry, I just wanna]\n\nThat's the way I came into this world,\nThe doctor said, \"Lady, she's a beautiful girl.\"\nHe gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled,\nSo give it up, honey, 'cause I want it.\nYeah.\n"}
