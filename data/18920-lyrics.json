Baby I need to know \n\nBut now is the day I wish you could come back to make us true \nBut you're long gone away, now I'm missing you \nI'm missing you baby, I miss you \nI'm talking to you baby, I miss you \n\nI thought you'd be with me forever \nBut I guess someone took my place \nTook the place of me loving you \nMaking love to you all through the night \nI wish you were still here \nSo I could see your pretty face again \nPlease come back and rescue me \nFrom all this pain and misery \n\nThere's nothing I wouldn't do to get back next to you \nI'm missing you every day (I'm missing you every day) \nI just can't go on this way (I just can't go on this way) \nCome back to me, I'm begging you please \nI'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please \nI miss you"}
