Come on out and hear him say\nGonna get you now! Gonna get to you!\nWe're livin' by this inspiration\n\nCome on, baby, come on!\nYou 'n' nobody else\nCome on, baby, come on!\nJust walk this way\nCome on, baby, come on!\nYou 'n' nobody else\nI wanna take you! So close to you!\n\nJust gotta touch me, touch me\n\nCan't you say it to my eyes, to my face?\nThere's no need to wait\nGonna get you now! Gonna get to you!\nWe're livin' by this inspiration"}
