I like you a lot\nYou are so beautiful and that is a fact\nYeah, yeah\nJealous\nI watch the sun, it cuts through the cloudy skies\nIt heals these wounds and makes me glad to be alive\nSo don't you worry, no don't you worry\nI'll make you happy, happy\nYeah, yeah\nSomething's wrong, something's wrong with you\nJealous, yeah\nSomething's really wrong, something's wrong with you\nJealous, Jealous, Jealous, Jealous\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nJealous, Jealous\nI spot two lovers on the Old Brompton Road\nI feel so jealous, I need someone to hold\nWho's hurt you baby? I Like you a lot\nI look at you and I know that something's up\nSomething's wrong, something's wrong with you\nJealous\nSomething's really wrong, something's wrong with you\nJealous, Jealous, Jealous, Jealous\nHow do you like the cat\nKitty, kitty, kitty"}
