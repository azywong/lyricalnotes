Where I was born\nWhere I was raised\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays\nWhere I ran off cause I got mad\nAnd it came to blows with my old man\nWell I came back and settled down\nThis is where they'll put me in the ground\nYeah this is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah this is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nMy town\n\nThere ain't much going on here since they closed the mill\nThat Whistle still blows every day at noon\nA bunch of us still go down to the diner\nI wonder if that Interstates still coming through\nBut come Sunday morning service at the Church of Christ\nWell there ain't an empty seat to be found\nAnd this is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah this is my town\n(Nana na na na)\nWhere I was born\nWhere I was raised\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays\nWhere I ran off cause I got mad\nAnd it came to blows with my old man\nWell I came back and settled down\nIt's where they'll put me in the ground\nThis is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah this is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nMy town\n\nWell I bought and painted up that rusty tractor\nYou can't miss it It's sitting right there in our yard\nThe County came and took that water tower\nAnd that's Jennie with a baby in the car\nWell we're off to Sunday service at the Church of Christ\nAnd if we want a seat we better leave right now\nAnd maybe later me and T-Roy will show you around, our town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah this is my town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah Where I was born\nWhere I was raised\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays\nWhere I ran off cause I got mad\nAnd it came to blows with my old man\nWell I came back and settled down\nThis is where they'll put me in the ground\nThis is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nYeah this is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nThis is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nMy town (My town)\n(Nana na na na)\nThis is My town\n(Nana na na na)\nMy town\n(Nana na na na)\nThis is My town\n(Nana na na na)"}
