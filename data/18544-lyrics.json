(Keyboard and Electric Guitar)\nIt was one of those great stories that you can't put down at night\nThe hero knew what he had to do and he wasn't afraid to fight\nThe villain goes to jail while the hero goes free\nI wish it were that simple for me\n\nAnd the reason that she loved him\nWas the reason I loved him too\nAnd he never wondered what was right or wrong\nHe just knew, he just knew\n\nInstrumental (Keyboard and Electric Guitar)\nShadow and shade mix together at dawn\nBut by the time you catch them simplicity's gone\nSo we sort through the pieces my friends and I\nSearching through the darkness to find the breaks in the sky\n\nAnd the reason that she loved him\nWas the reason I loved him too\nAnd he never wondered what was right or wrong\nHe just knew, he just knew\n\nInstrumental (Keyboard and Electric Guitar)\nAnd we wonder yes, we wonder\nHow do you make sense of this\nWhen the hero kills the maiden\nWith his kiss, with his kiss\n\nInstrumental (Keyboard and Electric Guitar)    Aaaah ...\nIt was one of those great stories that you can't put down at night\nThe hero knew what he had to do and he wasn't afraid to fight\nThe villain goes to jail while the hero goes free\nI wish it were that simple for me\n\nIt were that simple for me\n\nEnding (Keyboard and Electric Guitar)\nÂ© 1991 Hidden Pun Music Inc. / Stay Straight Music (BMI)\n"}
