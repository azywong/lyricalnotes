The straw that breaks my back\nI quit, unless you take it back\nWomen, what is it about them?\nCan't live with them or without them!\n\nTake me for what I am\nWho I was meant to be (Who I was meant to be)\nAnd if you give a damn (And if you give a damn, ya better)\nTake me baby or leave me (Oh, take me baby or leave me)\nTake me baby or leave me\n\nGuess I'm leavin'...\nI'm gone!"}
