It's a helluva life\n\nAnd we all have faith, and we all have hope\nBut we're all a little lost in the same damn boat\nIt's a helluva life, yeah, it's a helluva life\n\nSomething bout the night girl\nWhen you got the right girl\nSitting right beside you\nLooking at the sky, girl\nThinking bout why we're here\nAnd where we're going\nBaby, here we are\nAnd all I know is\n\nPennies make dimes and dimes make dollars\nDollars buy gas and longneck bottles\nBeer gets a barefoot country girl swaying\nTo a song that's playing and the world starts fadin'\nThe bad times make the good times better\nLook in her eyes and you're gone forever\nOn a heavenly ride\nYeah, it's a helluva life, it's a helluva life\n\nSomething bout the night, girl\nWhen you got the right, girl\nSitting right beside you\nLooking at the sky, girl\nThinking bout why we're here\nAnd where we're going\nBaby, here we are\nAnd all I know is\n\nPennies make dimes and dimes make dollars\nDollars buy gas and longneck bottles\nBeer gets a barefoot country girl swaying\nTo a song that's playing, it's a perfect combination\nThe bad times make the good times better\nLook in her eyes and you're gone forever\nOn a heavenly ride\nYeah, it's a helluva life, it's a helluva life\n\nBad times make the good times better\n\nAw one helluva life\n\nLook in her eyes and you're gone forever\n\nIt's a helluva life\n\nYeah, it's a helluva life\n\nIt's a helluva life"}
