Fuck it\nYou know we got your back like chiroprac-tic\nIf that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent\nNow hurry, hurry, go on to the altar\nI know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:\nKeep your heart Three Stacks, keep your heart\nHey, keep your heart Three Stacks, keep your heart\nMan, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart\nPlay your part... play your part\"\n\n[Verse 2: Pimp C]\n(Sweet Jones)\nMy bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber\nNever in the sheets, like it on top of the cover\nMoney on the dresser, drive a Kompressor\nTop notch hoes get the most, not the lesser\nTrash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club\nFuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love\nShe be cross country, givin' all that she got\nA thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot\nI smashed up the gray one, bought me a red\nEvery time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head\nSome hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary\nYour bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy\n\n[Verse 3: Bun B]\nBaby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team\nThe grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean\nI show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World\nAnd I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl\nWhen I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style\nNeed a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile\nWe piling up the paper on the dining room table\n'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable\nWe rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack\nWhat I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?\nI'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch\nPut my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich\nEasy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3\nGet down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B\n'Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?\nDon't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes\nWe tryna get chose\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nEeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or\nMake my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl\nDon't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip\nBut slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life\nThat's like makin' it rain every month on schedule\nLet me tell you, get your parasol umbrella\n'Cause it's gonna get wetter\nBetter prepare ya for the C support\nShe supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't\n\"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it\nSlaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets\nHad to tie her to a rocket\"\nSend her in to outer space, I know he wish he could\n'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good\nLike an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump\n'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump\n\"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up\nBetter choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up\n(Shit)\""}
