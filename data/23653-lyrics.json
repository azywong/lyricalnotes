Ya, I kissed her !\nSon ! You ought to see her sister!!!...\nYou've got to give a little something to a cool dark cat,\nfinding him a woman who could shake like that,\nHOTTIE ! She's a Hottie !!! Got a smokin' little body !\nString bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tatoo)\nShe's a rockin' that cowboy hat !\nHOTTIE ! She's a Hottie !!! and just a little bit naughty !\nKayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey HEY hey hey HEY ....\n\nShe's slappin' down a dam\nwhere the moss gets thick,\na yellin' \"YeeHaw !\" she's a red-neck chick,\nspittin' in the fire, puttin' on a show, struttin like a chicken to the radio,\nHey Slick ! She's a hick !!!\nHmmm. and her buttermilk lipstick\ngive a little something to a cool dark cat,\nfinding him a woman who could shake like that,\nHOTTIE ! She's a Hottie !!! She got a smokin' little body !\nString bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tatoo)\nShe's a rockin' that cowboy hat !\nHOTTIE ! She's a Hottie !!! and just a little bit naughty !\nSinging Kayay digidigy,\nKayay digidigy, yey HEY hey hey HEY ....\n\nDress her up boys, I took her from the farm,\nI brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm,\nyou've got to give a little somethin' to a cool dark cat,\nfinding him a woman who could walk like that!\nShe's a Hottie !!! She's a Hottie !!! She's got a smokin' little body !\nString bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tatoo)\nShe's rockin' that cowboy hat !\nHottie !!! She's a Hottie !!! and just a little bit naughty !\nKayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey\nSinging Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy\nyey hey HEY hey HEY ....\n\n....(instrumental music)....\n\nsinging Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, Yey HEY hey HEY ...."}
