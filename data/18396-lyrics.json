What's wrong?\nYou're not concentrating\nYes, I am concentrating\nNo, you're not\nI'm sorry, let's just do it again\nNonono, uh uh. What's the problem\nThere's no problem\nDawn, what's wrong?\nThere's nothing wrong, Terry\nKevin\nMmhm\nPlease don't tell me it's Kevin\nMmhm\nEw, Kevin Swahili, I knew it! He's got cooties\nAnd he's seeing Tamika right now\nAnd everybody else\nHe is not seeing Raneka\nHe is\nHow you know?\nWait a minute guys\nWait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's\nSerious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So, let's deal with\nThe problem\nYou see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk\nAnd it goes a little something like this - hit it\nMmm.....\n\nVerse 1:\nBaby girl (unfair but true)\nCan love him once but not twice\nWho plays games with no rules (a fool)\nTears for fears (are no surprise)\nHappens almost every time\nLove knocks you on your behind\n(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)\nLove 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)\nYou must be strong\nStand up on your own\nTake control of your life\nI've seen it time and time again\nIt's not worth it, no\nDon't be down and miserable\nYou and only you\nCan bring yourself around\n\nChorus:\nGive it up, turn it loose\nOh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah\nGive it up, turn it loose\nOh, you got to have\n\nVerse 2:\nFact of life (so sad but true)\nLove can often hurt you\nLeaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)\nBut fairytales of love, can come true\nBoth play tricks on your mind\n(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)\nSooner or later (bad feelings will die)\nYou must be strong\nDon't blame it all on love\nIn time good things will come\nI've seen time and time again\nIt's not worth it, no no\nDon't be down and miserable\nYou and only you\nCan bring yourself around\n\nChorus:\nGive it up, turn it loose\nOh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah\nGive it up, turn it loose\nOh, you got to have\n(Give it up)\nGive it up\n(Give up)\nGive it up\n(Give up)\nGive it up\nGive it up turn it loose\nTurnin' it loose, baby\n(repeat till fade)"}
