I'll walk\n\nIt was a dark night, a black dress\nDriver never saw her, around the bend\nI never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital\nWhen they said her legs still wouldn't move\nI cried, when I walked into her room\n\nShe said, I'll walk\nPlease come and hold my hand\nRight now I'm hurt, and I don't understand\nLets just be quiet, and later we can talk\nPlease stay, don't worry. I'll walk\n\nI held her hand through everything\nThe weeks and months of therapy\nAnd I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride\nShe's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle\nSo from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles\n\nAnd says, I'll walk\nPlease hold my hand\nI know that this will hurt, I know you understand\nPlease daddy don't cry\nThis is already hard\nLet's go, don't worry\nI'll walk"}
