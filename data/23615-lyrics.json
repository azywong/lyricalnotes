Woo!\r\n\r\nSometimes I walk a little faster\r\nin the school hallway\r\njust to get next to you.\r\nSome days I spend a little extra time\r\nin the morning, just to impress you.\r\n\r\nGuess you don't notice.\r\nGuess you don't need this.\r\nSad, you're not seeing what you're missing.\r\nOn the outside shyin' away.\r\nOn the inside dyin' to say.\r\n\r\nI'm unusual. Not so typical.\r\nWay too smart to be waiting around.\r\nTai chi practicing. Snowboard champion.\r\nI can fix the flat on your car.\r\nI might even be a rock star.\r\nI might even be a rock star.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wish when the phone\r\nrings that it would be you saying, &quot;Let's hang out.&quot;\r\nThen you'd confess that\r\nthere's something special between us.\r\nWhy don't we find out?\r\n\r\nYou don't even know me. Guess you don't need me.\r\nWhy you not seein' what you're missin'?\r\nOn the outside shyin' away.\r\nOn the inside dyin' to say. Woo!\r\n\r\nI'm unusual. Not so typical.\r\nWay too smart to be waiting around.\r\nTai chi practicing. Snowboard champion.\r\nI can fix the flat on your car.\r\nI might even be a rock star.\r\n\r\nIf you only knew the real me.\r\nI might even be a rock star.\r\nI'm telling you that we are meant to be.\r\nNow wouldn't it be nice if you\r\ncould see that I really am a rock star.\r\n\r\nYeah-yeah. Woo! Yeah, I really am a rock star.\r\nHey hey hey!\r\n\r\nWoo! A rock star!\r\nI'm unusual. Not so typical.\r\nWay too smart to be waiting around.\r\nTai chi practicing. Snowboard champion.\r\nI can fix the flat on your car...\r\n\r\nRocking it wherever we are. Yeah-yeah!\r\nYeah, I really am a rock star!\r\nYeah, I really am a rock star!\r\n\r\nI am a rock star.\r\nWo-oh-oh.\r\nYeah! Goodnight Everybody!!"}
