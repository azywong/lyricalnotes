It's just a\nMissunderstanding I'm not so demanding\nNever will you play with my heart\nMissunderstanding I don't know\nWhat you're planning never will you tear me apart\nI know I must be dreaming all these brand new friends\nAnd I've never seen such clever ways to make amends\nYou never know who's scheming is she out for self?\nNowadays you've got to be protected and it's not for health\nDon't you know she drives me crazy, does she like my walk\nOr maybe all she knows is that money talks money, money, money\nIt's a shame the way it is I really like her smile\nI'd like to get to know her 'cause she drives me wild\nCan you tell me why hey, you need diamonds, you need pearls\nAnd I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em\nDon't you know, don't you know to be my lady, to by my lady\nDrive my Mercedes drive my Mercedes start giving me that lovin' hey\nMissunderstanding I'm not so demanding\nNever will you play with my heart\nMissunderstanding I don't know\nWhat you're planning never will you tear me apart\nCan't you read between the lines? I never go for self\nShould I try to sleep the lady and misuse my wealth?\nI don't know the times have changed I can't sell out\nI grew up doing right and I won't throw it out\nCan you tell me why hey, you need diamonds, you need pearls\nAnd I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em\nDon't you know, don't you know to be my lady, to by my lady\nDrive my Mercedes drive my Mercedes start giving me that lovin' hey\nMissunderstanding I'm not so demanding\nNever will you play with my heart\nMissunderstanding I don't know\nWhat you're planning never will you tear me apart\nYo Eddie F, are you in here? Yeah, ha, ha, ha, yeah\nI thought so sounding swell you know what I'm saying? Yeah\nYou know what time it is now right? Nevelle get funky\nMissunderstanding, missunderstanding\nMissunderstanding, that's all it is\nMissunderstanding I'm not so demanding\nNever will you play with my heart\nMissunderstanding I don't know\nWhat you're planning never will you tear me apart"}
