Let's roll onto something new\nTaking its toll and I'm leaving without you\nI'm ready, let's roll onto something new\n\n'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this\nI said heaven ain't close in a place like this\nBring it back down, bring it back down tonight\nNever thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight\n\nWell somebody told me\nYou had a boyfriend\nWho looked like a girlfriend\nThat I had in February of last year\nIt's not confidential\nI've got potential\nA rushin', a rushin' around\n\nPace yourself for me\nI said maybe baby please\nBut I just don't know now\nWhen all I wanna do is try\n\nSomebody told me\nYou had a boyfriend\nWho looked like a girlfriend\nThat I had in February of last year\nIt's not confidential\nI've got potential\nA rushin', a rushin' around"}
