Dilla]\n\n[Hook]\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\n\n[Verse 1: Fat Lip]\nI must admit on some occasions\nI went out like a punk and a chump\nOr a sucka or something to that effect\nRespect I used to never get\nCause all I got was upset\nWhen niggas used to be like\n(\"What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!\")\nAnd tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip\nFor no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face\nDown the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at 3\nWondering, \"Why is everybody always pickin' on me?\nI tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this\nBut when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared\nTo deal with scrappin' no doubt\nMy pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out\nBut now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own\nFuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown\nI'm not tryin' to show no macho is shown\nBut when it's on, if it's on, then it's on\n\n[Hook]\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\n\n[Verse 2: Slim Kid Tre]\nOne, two... so listen here...\nThere comes a time in every man's life\nWhen he's gotta handle shit up on his own\nCan't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze\nPlease, they got problems of their own\nDown for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven\nTil they faced these fears in these fear zones\nUsed to get jacked back in high school, I played it cool\nJust so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from\nThey let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck\nCould lynch a helpless colored figure and\nAs a victim I invented low-key\nTill the keyhole itself got lower than me\nSo I stood up and let my free form form free\nSaid I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me\nI don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze\nIn other words, just debris\n\n[Hook]\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\n\n[Verse 3: Imani]\nIt's 1995\nAnd now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders\nHeavy as boulders, but I told y'all\nUntil the day that I die I still\nWill be a soldier and that's all I told ya\nAnd that's all I showed ya\nAnd all this calamity is rippin' my sanity\nCan it be (that I'm a celebrity\nWho's on the brink of insanity?)\nNow don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me\nCause when you in my position, it ain't never easy\nTo do any type of maintainin'\nCause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'\nIs hella strainin' (to the brain and)\nBut I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'\n\n[Hook]\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away\nCan't keep running away"}
