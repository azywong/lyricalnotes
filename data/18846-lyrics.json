Not a bit! Natural kind of wit\nShe'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair\nThe most beautiful house in the world has a mortgage\nWhat do I care ? It's \"Good-bye, care\"\nWhen my slippers are next to the ones that belong\nTo the one and only beautiful girl in the world\nLengthy instrumental break\nSocial ? Not a bit! She's got a natural kind of wit\nAnd I tell ya, she'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair\nThe most beautiful house in the world, it has a mortgage\nWhat do I care ? It's \"Good-bye, care\"\nWhen my slippers are next to the ones that belong\nTo the one and only beautiful girl\nThe one and only beautiful girl\nThe one and only beautiful girl in the world"}
