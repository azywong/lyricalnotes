Dirty South!)\nHip, hip hop (West Coast!)\nHip hop (Midwest!)\nHip hop (Let's go!)\n\n[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(Hip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead)\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nYeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner\nGet cash, live fast, body their man's mama\nQuick fast, trigger fingers on the llama\nRevenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja\nWord to the wise with villain state of minds\nGrindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind\nGrindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind\n(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)\nWhenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up\nAny ghetto will tell ya, \"Nas helped grow us up\"\nMy face once graced promotional Sony trucks\nHundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up\nGave my man my right, I could have went left\nSo like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf\nSo people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?\n\n[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(Hip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead)\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nThe bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'\nCome through, something ill, missing the ceilin'\nWhat influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings\nKidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings\nCriticize that, why's that?\n‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap\n‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens\nMost intellectuals will only half listen\nSo you can't blame jazz musicians\nOr David Stern with his NBA fashion issues\nOh, I think they like me, in my white tee\nYou can't ice me, we here for life, B\nOn my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey\nAnd for that, we not taking it lightly\nIf hip hop should die, we die together\nBodies in the morgue lie together, all together now\n\n[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(Hip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead)\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nEverybody sound the same, commercialize the game\nReminiscing when it wasn't all business\nIt forgot where it started\nSo we all gather here for the dearly departed\nHip-hopper since a toddler\nOne homeboy became a man, then a mobster\nIf it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka\nRIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta\nWent from turntables to MP3's\nFrom \"Beat Street\"to commercials on Mickey D's\nFrom gold cables to Jacobs\nFrom plain facials to Botox and face lifts\nI'm looking over my shoulder\nIt's about 80 people from my hood that showed up\nAnd they came to show love\nSold out concert and the doors are closed shut"}
