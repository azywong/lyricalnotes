If you say no\nAin't it just the way life goes\nPeople fear what they don't know\nCome along for the ride\nCome along for the ride\n\n(CHORUS)\n'Cause I'm a gypsy are you coming with me?\nI might steal your clothes \nand wear them if they fit me\nNever made agreements, just like a gypsy\nAnd I won't back down cause life's already bit me\nAnd I won't cry \nI'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me\n'Cause I'm gypsy"}
