Well now, we call this the act of mating\nBut there are several other very important differences\nBetween human beings and animals that you should know about\n\nI'd appreciate your input\n\n[Verse 1]\nSweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought\nMe and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about\nSo put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts\nYes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up\nYou've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds\nI want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns\nCome quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined\nTo make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time\n\n[Chorus]\nDo it now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nDo it again now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nGetting horny now\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket\nLike the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it\nHieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas\nBut I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means \"Small Craft Advisory\"\nSo, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship\nPlease turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip\nSo show me yours, I'll show you mine, \"Tool Time,\" you'll Lovett just like Lyle\nAnd then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch \"X-Files\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDo it now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nDo it again now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nGetting horny now\n\n[Bridge]\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nDo it again now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nDo it now\n\n[Chorus]\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nDo it again now\nYou and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals\nSo, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel\nGetting horny now"}
