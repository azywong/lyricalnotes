Oh\n\nOne step ahead, one step behind it\nNow you gotta run to get even\nMake future plans I'll dream about yesterday, hey!\nCome on turn, turn this thing around\n\n(Right Now !)\nHey! It's your tomorrow !\n(Right Now !)\nCome on, it's everything !\n(Right Now!)\nCatch your magic moment\ndo it right here and now \nIt means everything...\n\nMiss a beat, you lose a rhythm\nAnd nothin' falls into place\nOnly missed by a fraction\nSlipped a little off your pace\n\nThe more things you get, the more you want\nJust trade in one for another\nWorkin' so hard to make it easy\nGot to turn, come on\nTurn this thing around\n\n(Right Now !)\nHey! It's your tomorrow !\n(Right Now !)\nCome on, it's everything !\n(Right Now !)\nCatch your magic moment\ndo it right here and now \nIt means everything...\nIt's enlightened me\nRight now\nWhat are you waitin' for?\nOoooh ! Yeah !\nRight now !\n\n(Right Now !)\nHey! It's your tomorrow !\n(Right Now !)\nCome on, it's everything !\n(Right Now !)\nCatch your magic moment\nand do it right here and now !\nOoooh, right now !\nIt's what's happening...\nRight here and now !\nRight now, it's right now !\nOooh\nTell me, what are you waitin' for?\nTurn this thing around..."}
