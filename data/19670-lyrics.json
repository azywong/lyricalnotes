She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.\r\nHer soul slides away; but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.\r\n\r\nTake me to the place where you go, where nobody knows, if it's night or day.\r\nBut please don't put your life in the hands, of a rock 'n' roll band, who'll throw it all away.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna start a revolution from my bed, 'cause you said the brains I had went to my head.\r\nStep outside 'cause summertime's in bloom.\r\nStand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face, 'cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Sally can wait. She knows it's too late as she's walking on by.\r\nMy soul slides away; but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.\r\n\r\nSo, Sally can wait. She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.\r\nHer soul slides away; but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.\r\n\r\nSo, Sally can wait. She knows it's too late as she's walking on by.\r\nMy soul slides away; but don't look back in anger,\r\nDon't look back in anger,\r\nI heard you say.\r\n\r\nAt least not today."}
