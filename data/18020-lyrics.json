Etc\n\nI see a river flowing by me\nHeading for the sea\nI get a feeling deep inside me\nIt's so good to be free\nI've got sunshine in the daytime\nAnd moonlight every night\nAnd I'm just groovin ...... Etc\n\nChorus\n\nThat I'm just groovin, groovin\nGrooving out on life\nI'm just groovin and I can't stop movinG...\nGroovin till I die..."}
