{"song_name":"The Story","artist_id":"null","display_artist":"Sara Ramirez","spotify_id":"null","lyrics":"All of these lines across my face\nTell you the story of who I am\nSo many stories of where I've been\nAnd how I got to where I am\nBut these stories don't mean anything\nWhen you've got no one to tell them to\nIt's true...I was made for you\n\nI climbed across the mountain tops\nSwam all across the ocean blue\nI crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules\nBut baby I broke them all for you\nBecause even when I was flat broke\nYou made me feel like a million bucks\nYeah you do and I was made for you\n\nYou see the smile that's on my mouth\nIs hiding the words that don't come out\nAnd all of my friends who think that I'm blessed\nThey don't know my head is a mess\nNo, they don't know who I really am\nAnd they don't know what I've been through like you do\nAnd I was made for you...\n\nAll of these lines across my face\nTell you the story of who I am\nSo many stories of where I've been\nAnd how I got to where I am\nBut these stories don't mean anything\nWhen you've got no one to tell them to\nIt's true...I was made for you\nOh yeah it's true... I was made for you"}
