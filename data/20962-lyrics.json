That's okay.\nYou never loved me anyway.\nAnd I think it's time for you, to just move.  {So long, so long, so long.}\n\nThat's all right.  {That's all right.}  That's okay.  {That's okay.}\nI bet you never thought you'd hear me say.\nThat I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde.\nCause it's not me, no, no.\nCause it's not me, no, no.\nOh, no.\n\nLast night I went to a party hoping I'd see you there.  {Went to a party.}\nAnd sure enough, you were hanging on some other girl playing with her hair.\nAnd I overheard you telling her the very same thing you said to me the night before.\nHook, line, and sinker you were walking with her out the door.\n\nThat's all right.  That's okay.\nYou never loved me anyway.  {I never loved you anyway.}\nAnd I think it's time for you, to just move on.  {So long, so long, so long.}\n\nThat's all right.  That's okay.\nI bet you never thought you'd hear me say.\nThat I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde.\nCause it's not me, no, no.\n\nYou want just a little trophy, hanging on your arm so,\nAll your friends will see you got it going on.\nBut, I see, what you are so clearly.\nAnd baby, baby, that's not all right with me.\n\nThat's all right, that's okay.\nI never loved you anyway.\nThat's all right, that's okay.\nYou never loved me anyway.\nYou never loved me, but it's all right.\nBut it's all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.\nGo ahead and find what you need.\n\nThat's all right.  That's okay.  {Cause it's all right with me.}\nYou never loved me anyway.\nAnd I think it's time for you, to just move on.  {So long, so long, so long.}\n\n(Fading)\nThat's all right.  That's okay.\nI bet you never thought you'd hear me say.\nThat I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde.\nCause it's not me, no, no.\n"}
