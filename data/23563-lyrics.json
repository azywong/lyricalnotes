Whoa! I,\r\nI can't wait to see you again,\r\n\r\nI got this crazy feeling\r\nDeep inside\r\nWhen you called and asked to see me\r\nTomorrow night,\r\nI'm not a mind reader,\r\nBut I'm reading the signs\r\nThat you can't wait to see me again\r\n\r\nThe last time I freaked out,\r\nI just kept looking down,\r\nI st-st-stuttered when\r\nYou asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout\r\nFelt like I couldn't breathe,\r\nYou asked what's wrong with me,\r\nMy best friend Lesley said:\r\n\"She's just being Miley!\"\r\n\r\nThe next time we hang out,\r\nI will redeem myself\r\nMy heart can't rest till then,\r\nWhoa! Whoa! I,\r\nI can't wait to see you again,\r\n\r\nI've got my sight set on you,\r\nAnd I'm ready to aim,\r\n\r\nThe last time I freaked out,\r\nI just kept looking down,\r\nI st-st-stuttered when\r\nYou asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout\r\nFelt like I couldn't breathe,\r\nYou asked what's wrong with me,\r\nMy best friend Lesley said:\r\n\"She's just being Miley\"\r\n\r\nThe next time we hang out,\r\nI will redeem myself\r\nMy heart can't rest till then,\r\nWhoa! Whoa! I,\r\nI can't wait to see you again,\r\nWhoa! Whoa! I,\r\nI can't wait to see you again."}
