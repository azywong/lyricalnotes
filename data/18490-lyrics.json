Smith / Wayne Kirkpatrick\n\nCounting every moment\nBiding all my time\nStanding out here on my own\nSearching for that someone\nTo heal this heart of mine\nAnd keep me from being alone\nBut when will it be\nAnd how will I know\nI don't want to wait here forever\nChorus:\nSomebody love me\nCome and carry me away\nSomebody need me\nTo be the blue in their grey\nSomebody want me\nThe way I've always dreamed it could be\nWon't somebody love me, love me\n\nI'm waiting for somebody\nTo dance across the floor\nSweeping me off of my feet\nI'm looking for the right one\nTo open up that door\nAnd offer me a tender retreat\nIt's like wanting to sing\nBut needing a song\nWhen will I hear the music playing\n\nChorus\n"}
