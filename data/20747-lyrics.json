Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?\nFrom the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that\nWhen I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback\nBeatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK\nOpen can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah\nHardrock, ever since, junior high escuela\nFly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up\nI'm fed up, niggas wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!\nI'mma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off\nWith a gre-nade, now you flappin, like a mermaid\nYappin off, bitch you cough at the lips\nWhile I'm at the bar, baggin, the bartender tips\nThen I bag this chick, with a, \"Hi,\" and the eye\nShe did the butterfly, rubbin her ass, against my buttonfly\nI could ALREADY imagine my shit stuck inside\nEverytime I strike, haters be like, \"Dat fucking guy!\"\n\nChorus: Beatnuts + Yellaklaw\n\nHow's that yo?
