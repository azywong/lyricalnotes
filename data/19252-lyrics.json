I never understood, black\nWhy the jocks get the fly girls and, me, I get the hood rats\nI tell 'em, \"Scat, skittle, scabobble\"\nGot hit with a bottle and I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess\nI confess, it's a shame when you living in a city\nThat's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name\nGlad I came to my senses\nLike quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach\nOvercometh by the thoughts of me and her together, right?\nSo when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type\n\n[Hook]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback\nAnd everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at\nAnd when I'm in my car, I'm laid back\nI got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat\nAnd do you really wanna know what's really wack?\nSee, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?\nI heard that prom night is a bomb night\nWith the hood rats you can hold tight\nBut really though, I'm a Figaro\nWhen I'm in my car, I can't even get a hello\nWell, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday\nWell then I'mma have to get in my car and go\nYou know I take the 110 until the 105\nGet off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, \"Look alive\"\n'Cause it's hard to survive when you're living\nIn a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by\nShe looks fly, she looks fly\nMake me say, \"My, my, my\"\n\n[Hook]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\n\n[Bridge]\nI wish I was a little bit taller\nI wish I was a baller\nI wish I was a little bit taller\nI wish I was a baller\nI wish I was a little bit taller, y'all\nI wish I was a baller\nI wish I was a little bit taller\nI wish I was a baller\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey, I wish I had my way 'cause every day would be a Friday\nAnd you could even speed on the highway\nI would play ghetto games\nName my kids ghetto names, Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine\nYo, you know that's on the real\nSo if you're down on your luck\nThen you should know just how I feel\n'Cause if you don't want me around\nSee, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound\nHey, you, what's that sound?\nEverybody look what's going down\nAh, yes, ain't that fresh?\nEverybody wants to get down like that\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six four Impala\n\n[Outro]\nI wish, I wish\nI wish, I wish\nI wish, I wish\nI wish, I wish\nI wish, I wish\nI wish, I wish"}
