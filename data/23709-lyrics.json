Forever we waited (ha ha!)\nAnd they told us we were never gonna get it\nBut we took it on the road (to the riches)\nOn the road (to the ghetto)\nOn the road (from the projects to this bangin' instrumental)\nOn the road (ride with me!)\nOn the road (we come to get it)\nOn the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]\nWhen it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected\nIt seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected\nAt best we were stressed\nAt the worst they probably said we're pathetic\nHad all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it\nI was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line\nNever restin' the question if I was out of my mind\nIt finally came time to do it or let it die\nSo we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride\nSing it, yeah!\n\n[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]\nTogether we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)\nWe made it even though we had our backs up against the wall\n(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)\nAnd they told us we were never gonna get it\nBut we took it on the road (to the riches)\nOn the road (to the ghetto)\nOn the road (from the projects to this bangin' instrumental)\nOn the road (ride with me!)\nOn the road (we come to get it)\nOn the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nLook, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'\nShit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children\nNow on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come\nFightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from\nFrom nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son\nTo countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was\nBut now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it\nLet's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it\nSing it!\n\n[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]\nTogether we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)\nWe made it even though we had our backs up against the wall\n(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)\nAnd they told us we were never gonna get it\nBut we took it on the road (to the riches)\nOn the road (to the ghetto)\nOn the road (from the projects to this bangin' instrumental)\nOn the road (ride with me!)\nOn the road (we come to get it)\nOn the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)"}
