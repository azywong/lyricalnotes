You're a loaded gun... Yeah...\nOh... There's nowhere to run\nNo one can save me\nThe damage is done!\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name. (Bad name)\nI play my part and you play your game\nYou give love a bad name. (Bad name)\nYou give love a bad name\n\nPaint your smile on your lips\nBlood red nails on your fingertips\nA school boy's dream, you act so shy\nYour very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye\n\nOh... You're a loaded gun... Yeah...\nOh... There's nowhere to run\nNo one can save me\nThe damage is done!\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name\nI play my part and you play your game\nYou give love a bad name\nYou give love...\n\n(Beatboxing)\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nDarling, you give love a bad name\nI play my part and you play your game\nYou give love a bad name, (Bad name)\nYou give love a bad name!\nYou give love a bad bad name!\nA bad name\nYou give love a bad name\nYou give love.... a bad name"}
