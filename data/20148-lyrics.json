I was worried about you\nCan you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy\"\n(I said) I'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears\n\nI saw a friend of mine He said, \"I was worried about you\nI heard she had another man, I wondered how you felt about it?\"\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears\nSaw my lawyer, Mr. Good News\nHe got me joint custody and legal separation\n(So) I'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears\n\nI took a walk alone last night,\nI looked up at the stars\nTo try and find an answer in my life\nI chose a star for me, I chose a star for him,\nI chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife\nSomething made me smile. Something seemed to ease the pain\nSomething about the universe and how it's all connected\n\nThe park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream\nWe try to do the best within the given time\nA kid should be with his mother,\nEverybody knows that\nWhat can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?\nI saw that friend of mine, he said, \"You look different somehow\"\nI said, \"Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime\"\n(I said) I'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears. I'm laughing through my tears\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears. I'm laughing through my tears"}
