So run, Joey, run, Joey, run!\"\n\nRachel:\nDaddy please don't, it wasn't his fault\nHe means so much to me\nDaddy please don't, we're gonna get married\nJust you wait and see\n\nJesse:\nGot in my car and drove like mad 'til I reached Julie's place\nShe ran to me with tear-filled eyes and bruises on her face!\nAll at once I saw him there, sneaking up behind me (Rachel: Watch out!)\nThen Julie yelled, \"He's got a gun!\"\nFinn:\nAnd she stepped in front of me\n\nThen suddenly, a shot rang out and I saw Julie falling!\nI ran to her, I held her close\nWhen I looked down, my hands were red\nAnd here's the last words Julie said...\n\nRachel:\nDaddy please don't, it wasn't his fault\nHe means so much to me\nDaddy please don't, we're gonna get mar...ried...\n\nPuck, Jesse & Finn:\nRun, Joey, run, Joey, run, Joey\nRun, Joey, run, Joey, run, Joey, ruuuuuunn!!!"}
