I know I will\nI'll pretend my ship's not sinking\nAnd I'll tell myself I'm over you\n'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking\nI am the king of wishful thinking\n\nI refuse to give in to my blues\nThat's not how it's going to be\nAnd I deny the tears in my eyes\nI don't want to let you see... no\nThat you have made a hole in my heart\nAnd now I've got to fool myself...\n\nI'll get over you... I know I will\nI'll pretend my ship's not sinking\nAnd I'll tell myself I'm over you\n'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking...\nI'll get over you... I know I will\nI'll pretend my ship's not sinking\nAnd I'll tell myself I'm over you\n'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking\n\nI will never, never shed a tear for you\nI'll get over you\n\nIf I don't listen to the talk of the town\nThen maybe I can fool myself...\n\nI'll get over you... I know I will\nI'll pretend my ship's not sinking\nAnd I'll tell myself I'm over you\n'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking\nI'm the king of wishful thinking\nI'll get over you... I know I will\nYou made a hole in my heart\nBut I won't shed a tear for you\nI'll be the king of wishful thinking\nI'll get over you...\nI'll pretend my heart's still beating\n'Cause I've got no more tears for you\nI'm the king of wishful thinking...\nI'll get over you... I know I will\nYou made a hole in my heart\nAnd I'll tell myself I'm over you\n'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking\n"}
