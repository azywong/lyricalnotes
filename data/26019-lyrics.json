(oh oh oh)\nI never said that I want this\nThis burden came to me\nAnd it's made it's home inside. (oh oh oh)\n\nIf I told you what I was\nWould you turn your back on me?\nAnd if I seem dangerous\nWould you be scared?\nI get the feeling just because\nEverything I touch isn't dark enough\nIf this problem lies in me\n\nI'm only a man with a candle to guide me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\nA monster, a monster\nI've turned into a monster\nA monster, a monster\nAnd it keeps getting stronger\n\nI'm only a man with a candle to guide me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\nA monster, a monster\nI've turned into a monster\nA monster, a monster\nAnd it keeps getting stronger"}
