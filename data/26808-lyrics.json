Cause I don't wanna walk alone\nI'm ready for this, there's no denying\nI'm ready for this, you stop me falling\nI'm ready for this, I need you all in\nI'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand\n\nSoul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me\nTell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave\nTrying find a moment where I can find release\nPlease tell me that you've got me\nAnd you're never gonna leave\n\nBreak my bones but you won't see me fall, oh\nThe rising tide will rise against them all, oh\n\nDarling, hold my hand\nOh, won't you hold my hand?\nCause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore\nWon't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone\nI'm ready for this, there's no denying\nI'm ready for this, you stop me falling\nI'm ready for this, I need you all in\nI'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand\n\nDon't wanna know\nThat feeling when I'm all alone\nSo please don't make me wait, cause I don't wanna break\nAnd I don't wanna fall\nWhen you're next to me\nCan tell I'm not afraid to be\nThat you don't make me wait, and never let me break\nYou never let me fall\n\nDarling, hold my hand\nOh, won't you hold my hand?\nCause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore\nWon't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone\nI'm ready for this, there's no denying\nI'm ready for this, you stop me falling\nI'm ready for this, I need you all in\nI'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand"}
