Shawty must know I'm the man\nMy money love her like a number one fan\nDon't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands\nMy Benjamin Frank-a-lins\nA couple of grands, I got rubberbands\nMy paper planes making her dance\nGet dirty all night, that's part of my plan\nWe building castles that's made out of sand\nShe's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun\nGirl won't you move a lil' closer?\nTime to get paid, it's maximum wage\nThat body belongs on a poster\nI'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya\nDoing a show like a gun out of holster\nTell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur cause\n\n[Hook: Ke$ha]\nYou spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down\n(You spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down)\n\n[Bridge: Flo Rida]\nFrom the top of the pole I watch her go down\nShe got me throwing my money around\nAin't nothing more beautiful to be found\nIt's going down down\nFrom the top of the pole I watch her go down\nShe got me throwing my money around\nAin't nothing more beautiful to be found\nIt's going down down\n\n[Verse 3: Flo Rida]\nYeeeah! I'm spending my money\nI'm outta control\nSomebody help me\nShe's taking my bank roll\nBut I'm king of the club\nAnd I'm wearing the crown\nPopping these bottles, touching these models\nWatching they asses go\nDown down down\n\n[Hook: Ke$ha]\nYou spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down\n(You spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down)\nYou spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down\n(You spin my head right round, right round\nWhen you go down, when you go down down)"}
