There are angels\n\nI'm nobodys promise and I'm nobodys chore\nAnd I ain't got nobody that I feel I gotta\nLive for - nobody to live for\nI'm nobodys work & I'm nobodys' company\nAnd every time I turn around I always seem to\nFind just me singin'\n\nThere are monsters, there are angels\n\nI'm nobodys' wife, I'm nobodys' baby\n\nThere are monsters, there are angels\nThere are monsters, there are angels\nI'm nobodys' mother, I'm nobodys' child"}
