I believe it\n\nYou broke the bonds, loosed the chains\nCarried the cross and all my shame\nAll my shame\nOh, I'm still runnin'\n\nBut I still haven't found what I'm looking for\nOh, I still haven't found it, what I'm looking for\nI still haven't found it\nI still haven't found it\nAnd I believe\n\nYes I'm still runnin'\nYes I'm still runnin'"}
