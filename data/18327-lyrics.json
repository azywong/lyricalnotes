Think ya got it goin` on?\nChump`s moves are all wrong\n\nIt`s not a hoax, no jokes, I smokes mic`s, like a Phillie Blunt\nDon`t ever try to front\nAnd it`s quite absurd yo, word to herb\nWhen your sleepin` on a Wahlberg\nStep to this and I`m a break you down to the knees\nSo, you gotta believe\n\nYou gotta believe Better believe it\nYou gotta believe Yo better believe\nYou gotta believe Better believe it\nYou gotta believe You better believe\n\nThe double M got more kick comin` from my rhyme\nAnd comin` from my 9, I rip it up on 2 or 3 times\nRemember that still droppin` kids like bricks\nWhile your hoe`s on tour tryin` to pull tricks\nGotta know this, doubt and your out for the count\nRunnin` ruff rhymes keeps me paid in large amounts\nMost of y`all got a problem, keep out my biz\nAnd everything`ll be straight: `There it is`\nBut if not get a conflict, please no problem\nI can handle that real quick\nI got too many tricks up my sleeve\nAnd I`m fully aware and prepared\nSo, you gotta believe\n\nYou gotta believe\nYou gotta believe\nYou gotta believe\nYou gotta believe"}
