We'll make it\r\nSwimming in a deep sea of blankets\r\nTake all your big plans and break 'em\r\nThis is bound to be a while\r\n\r\nYour body is a wonderland\r\nYour body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)\r\nYour body is a wonderland\r\n\r\nDamn baby, you frustrate me\r\nI know you're mine, all mine, all mine\r\nBut you look so good it hurts sometimes\r\n\r\nYour body is a wonderland\r\nYour body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)\r\nYour body is a wonderland\r\nYour body is a wonderland"}
