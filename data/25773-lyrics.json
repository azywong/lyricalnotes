Shine on!\n'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!\nSummer sky dripped in rhinestones,\nTurn your party lights on,\nBaby get your shine on - shine on!\nBaby get your shine on!\n\nSilverado, candy painted,\nRay Ban's got the whole world shaded.\nChrome piece tucked in the console,\nRiding high, roll up on the down low.\nFeeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky, clear.\nSo slide that little sugar shaker over here...\nAnd get your shine on!\n'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!\nSummer sky dripped in rhinestones,\nTurn your party lights on,\nBaby get your shine on - shine on!\nBaby get your shine on!\n\nHomemade jar,\nLemon drop take a sip.\nDon't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your... Shine on!\n'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!\nSummer sky dripped in rhinestones,\nTurn your party lights on,\nBaby get your shine on - shine on!\nBaby get your shine on!\n\nCause you and me be rocking all night long!\n\nSummer sky dripped in rhinestones,\nTurn your party lights on,\nBaby get your shine on - shine on!\n\nBaby get your shine on!\n\nBaby get your shine on!\n\nStrawberry shimmer on her lips,\nSilver buckle hanging off her hips.\nI sparkle when she smiles,\nShine down on the radio dial.\nSilverado, candy painted,\nRay Ban's got the whole world shaded.\nChromed piece tucked in the console.\nRiding high, roll up on the down low."}
