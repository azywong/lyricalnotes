Whoo-o!\nSweet as honey your lips like taste\nYou touch my body and you've been praised\nSo deep is my love for you\nAnticipated any single move\nYou are the one that I'm dreaming of\nWon't you stay with me tonight baby\nYou're all I want, all I'm thinking of\nMove your body close to mine\nChorus\nGimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o! Whoo-o!\nI've been waiting forever\nGimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o! Whoo-o!\nBoy I can't wait any longer\nDon't you know you got me under your spell\nYou drive me crazy like no-one else\nOne kiss and I'm hypnotised\nYou're looking to me with those spectrum eyes\nYou are the one that I'm dreaming of\nWon't you stay with me tonight baby\nYou're all I want, all I'm thinking of\nMove your body close to mine\nChorus\nI can't wait any longer\nIt feels so good inside I must be dreaming (Oooh dreaming)\nOnly you can satisfy this feeling\nAm I dreaming?\nAm I dreaming?\nAm I dreaming?\nChorus x 2\nGimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o!\nRepeat to fade"}
