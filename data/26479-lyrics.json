Amen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then I am human\nOnly then I am clean\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nTake me to church"}
