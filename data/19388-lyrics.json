Heyy-ayyaahhyy\n\n[Intro: 2Pac]\nYo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit!\nYou know what time\nBoo-yaow! I know it's time for you\nSo grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd uh, throw up that finger!\nHey yo, throw y'all fingers up!\nThug style, baby, thug style, y'know?\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nTell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya\nI can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya\nIf I'm wrong, Love, tell me\n'Cause I get caught up in the life I live, it's hell, see\nI never thought I'd see the day when I would calm down\nYou ain't heard? I've been known to clown and get around\nThat's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good\nYes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me\nWith your attitude to match, right?\nDon't be phony, 'cause I hate it when you act like\nYou don't know me, I've be stressin' in the spotlight\nI want the fame, but the industry's a lot like\nA crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go\nCan't be with you every minute miss, another show\nAnd even though I'm known for my one night stand\nLook here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—\n\n[Interlude: 2Pac]\nThrow up the finger!\nAnd all my homies go\nThrow them the finger!\nYou know what, baby, it's like—\n\n[Hook: Easy Mo Bee]\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nWill I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows\nGettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go\nIn my ride and I'm all in\nGettin' high, I can hear the people callin'\nI'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'\nAnd to God, gotta keep myself from fallin'\nBut it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure\nWhat do I do? Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up\nAnd say it's cool, should I stroke\nOr should I wait a while? You decide\nIf you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie\nMove close and let me whisper\nSome dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya\nOn every curve, slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow\nCan't hold it any longer so let it go\nOpen the gates to your waterfall up in heaven\nAnd don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—\n\n[Interlude: 2Pac]\nGive 'em the finger!\nAll my homies go, throw your fingers up!\nThat's just the thug in me, girl, you know\nPeep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—\n\n[Hook: Easy Mo Bee]\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nA lot of people think it's easy to settle down\nGot a woman that'll please me in every town\nI don't wanna but I gotta do it\nThe temptation got me ready to release the fluid\nSensation, sit down and conversate\nLike you know me, take my hand\n'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand\nEven the hardest of my homies need attention\nCatch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'\nI wanna take you to the movies and the park\nLet's find a spot for you to do me in the dark\nNow that it's passion, hold me tight\nDon't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight\nI know your man ain't lovin' you right\nYou're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life\nEnough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'\nSee you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nGive 'em the finger, and all my homies go\nYo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?\nThrow your fingers up!\nYou know? They gonna peep this\nThis how we run game on you\nAll my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!\nThrow your hands up, give 'em the finger!"}
