And can this be? \nYour girlfriend tryina sandwich me \nMy hearts colder than sandwich meat \nCuz I come from the hood where the hammers be \nI move fast but I switch pace \nAnd pop a listerine strip in \nBefore you get all up in the bitch face \nMovin your body like this \nGonna make me blow like a bottle of Cris \nMan I dunno. No, and how did it twist \nYa got my temperature risin \nFrom your hips and your thighs \nAnd that glare in your eyes'll brighten up the horizon \nIt comes naturally, I dont bribe em \nIts easy as one,two,three and I slide in \n\n[Chorus 2x]\n"}
