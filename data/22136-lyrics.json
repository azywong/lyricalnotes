Handy - won't you look down over me\nCause I got a first-class ticket\nAnd I'm blue as a boy can be\n\nWalking in Memphis\nWalking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nSaw the ghost of Elvis\nDown on Union Avenue\nFollowed him up to the gates of Graceland\nAnd watched him walk right through\nNow security they did not see him\nThey just hovered 'round his tomb\nThere's a pretty little thing\nWaitin' on \"The King\"\nDown in the Jungle Room\n\nWalking in Memphis\nWalking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nThey've got catfish on the table\nThey've got gospel in the air\nAnd Reverend Green be glad to see you\nWhen you haven't got a prayer\nYou got a prayer in Memphis\n\nNow Muriel plays the piano\nEvery Friday at the Hollywood\nAnd they brought me down to see her\nAnd they asked me if I would\nDo a little number\nAnd I sang with all my might\nShe said\n\"Tell me are you a Christian\"\nAnd I said \"Ma'am I am tonight\"\n\nWalking in Memphis\nWalking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nWalking in Memphis\nWalking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nWalking in Memphis\nWalking with my feet ten feet off of Beale\nWalking in Memphis\nBut do I really feel the way I feel\n\nWalking in Memphis"}
