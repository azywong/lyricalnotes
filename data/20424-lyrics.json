Rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop\nRedefinition say you're ruling hip-hop\nSay Black Star come to rock it non...\n\nYo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate\nThe whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it\nProjectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit\nMe and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth\nAfter this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk\nShining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin\nConnectin like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenaments\nCause all my Brooklyn residents, ? heavy regiments\nDon't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn WHAAAAAAAoohhhh\nSee that?  Bound to take it all kid, believe that\nFrom where they sellin tree at, to where the police be at\nTalib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at \n\n[Talib Kweli]\nBrooklyn New York City where they paint murals of Biggie\nIn cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty\nwhat a pity -- blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense\nTree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense\nMy presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection\nPeople thinkin MC is short hand for Mis Conception\nLet me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion\nthat most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate\nWalkin the streets is like battlin, be careful with your body\nYou must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade\nStop actin like a bitch already, be a visionary\nAnd maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary\nThird rate teacher readin and talkin about,\n\"I knew he'd amount to nothin\"\nNeighbors like, \"He was the quiet type,\nwho'd have thought they was frontin?\"\nTalkin +Loud+ like you in RCA, get carted away\nwith body parts and treys, what a way to start your day\nYo it's like\n\nChorus: Mos Def and Talib Kweli\n\nOne two three\nMos Def and Talib Kweli\nWe came to rock it on to the tip-top\nBest alliance in hip-hop, wyahhhhh\nI said one two three\nIt's kind of dangerous to be a emcee\nThey shot Tupac and Biggie\nToo much violence in hip-hop, wyahhhhh\n\n[Mos Def]\nI said Manhattan keep on makin it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin it (Bo!)\nSo relax we're takin it back, Redhook where we're livin at\nPlenty cats be strugglin not hustlin and bubblin\nIt ain't about production and -- what else we discussin?\nWhen the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows\nStrivin for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed\nCOLOSSAL, true original b-boy apostle\nStandin on the rooftop with the, Zulu gestapo\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYou think you the shit\nsomebody in the wings'll force you to quit\nIt could be your crew or click\nor some random kid you smoked buddha with\nConsider me the entity within the industry without a history\nof spittin the epitome, of stupidity -- livin my life\nexpressin my liberty, it gotta be done properly\nMy name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty\nPeople follow me and other cats they hear him flow\nAnd assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano\n\n[Mos Def]\nStill sippin wishin well water, imported, from Pluto\nThree hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers\nIn miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us\nin the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the +cheaters+\nA cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers\nYou can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us\n(line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just\nmake a pussy freeze up, thinkin we will ease up\n\nChorus\n"}
