In an mmmbop they're not there\nIn an mmmbop they're gone. In an mmmbop they're not there\nUntil you lose your hair. But you don't care\n(repeat chorus)\n\nCan you tell me? No you can't 'cause you don't know\nCan you tell me? You say you can but you don't know\nCan you tell me which flower's going to grow\nNo you can't 'cause you don't know\nCan you tell me if it's going to be a daisy or a rose\nYou say you can but you don't know\nCan you tell me which flower's going to grow\nNo you can't 'cause you don't know\nCan you tell me? You say you can but you don't know\nYou say you can but you don't know\nDon't know\n(repeat chorus)\n\nCan you tell me? No you can't 'cause you don't know\nCan you tell me? You say you can but you don't know\nYou say you can but you don't know\n"}
