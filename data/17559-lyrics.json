Woman!\r\nL.A. Woman.\r\nL.A. Woman!\r\nL.A. Woman.\r\n\r\nL.A. Woman Sunday afternoon.\r\nL.A. Woman Sunday afternoon.\r\nL.A. Woman Sunday afternoon.\r\nDrive through your suburbs.\r\nInto your blues.\r\nInto your blues. Yeah!\r\nInto your blue, blue, blues!\r\nInto your blues.\r\nOhh yeah!\r\n\r\nI see your hair is burning.\r\nHills are filled with fire.\r\nIf they say I never loved you.\r\nYou know they are a liar.\r\nDriving down your freeways.\r\nMidnite alleys roam.\r\n\r\nCops in cars, the topless bars.\r\nNever saw a woman...\r\nSo alone.\r\nSo alone.\r\nSo alone!\r\n\r\nWell, I just got into town about an hour ago.\r\nTook a look around, see which way the wind blow.\r\nWhere the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows.\r\n\r\nAre you a lucky little lady in the city of light?\r\nOr just another lost angel, in city of night?\r\nCity of Night.\r\nCity of Night!\r\nOhh yeah!\r\n\r\nL.A. Woman!\r\nL.A. Woman.\r\nL.A. Woman.\r\nYour my woman!\r\nThat's right!\r\nYour my woman!\r\n\r\n(By The Doors)"}
