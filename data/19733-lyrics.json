Don't go away, don't go away\nHey! Know what you say\nJust another day\nHey! You save my time\nAnd a lot of sunshine\nWell this is the trick\nAnd everybody feeling fine\nWhat time what time is it now?\nWe don't care\nWe enjoy the summer\nAnd the love that we share\nWe want you, yes, you, by our side\n\nDon't go away, please stay by my side\nJust hold me tight\nI wanna be with you tonight\nDon't go away and show me your love\nYou bring me joy\nYou are the center of my life\n\nYou know that you're my only lover\nAnd I hope that I am your, your only one, too\nYou said that there, there is no other\nAnd now I'm sitting here like a fool\n\nHey! Just take it slow, just take it slow\nHoh! Nowhere to running\nNowhere to go\nHey! Enjoy the party\nWith the rest of the crew\n'Cause what we do, we do it for you\nDon't stand around, come on, just kick it\n'Cause when we're in the house\nYou know we're getting wicked\nLet's have a party\n'Cause we love you so\n\nDon't go away, please stay by my side\nJust hold me tight\nI wanna be with you tonight\nDon't go away and show me your love\nYou bring me joy\nYou are the center of my life"}
