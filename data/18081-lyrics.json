And then You realize that there's no time\nNo direction as you fly through the wind; you stop to ponder on a pink\nChateau\nThe theme from \"Mahogany\" still transcends, but Quote Unquote, that's the way it goes\n\nI'm looking at the picture again. I'm looking at the picture again\nI spin the sun dial to expectation; twenty years ago I saw you yesterday\nYou're looking at the picture now, I see you looking at the picture now\nAnd for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a\nPaper doll\n\nChorus:\nOne of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll)\nPaper doll\nOne of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll)\nOh, paper doll\n\nImagine yourself as a cloud in the skyâ€“ you pass me by and I blow you a kiss\nA thinking cloud, so you're wondering why, only to find out it doesn't exist\nLife surrounds what's presumed as wise; it wouldn't be wise until the fist\nUncurls\nNo one I don't know ever stares in my eyes. Because of the quote unquote real world\n\nAnd mow I'm thinking about yesterday. I'm actually thinking about yesterday\nA thousand words say it doesn't make sense. A thousand ideas tell me otherwise\nYou're thinking about yesterday. And now you're thinking about yesterday, but for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll\n\nChorus\n\nRegardless of how you think, regardless of how you feel, see yourself as\nMore than a human being. It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally\nHold my hands forever, paper doll\n\nChorus"}
