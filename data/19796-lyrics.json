It's still one love, smokin'. It's just a whole lot\nmore money involved.\n\nVerse 1\nLeanin' out my zone\nI roams like mobile phones (right)\nrag top 'Vettes Yukons & hundred chromes\nSilly bitches lie in wait until the day I come home\nwhile the phone machine kicks\n\"Biitch Rich ain't at home\" (Ha)\nsix million ways to mob choose one\nI chose to dispose of those who call theyself foes\nfoes like bitches tuck they toes like hoes\nthese amateur niggas done turned pro\nCan't ride with the hi pro glow\nthe boss with the sauce\ngot receipts to show how much it cost\nI dedicate this to the ridahs\nwho like to slip sideways\nBeware devil's shuttin' down the highway\n\nChorus\nSomething about the West Coast\nShake it westsiide\nthrow ya hands up let's riide\nto the city of the scene\nput it on the one get ya body on the dance floor\nSomething about the West Coast It makes me wanna ride \n(Repeat)\n\nVerse 2\nHow many MC's must get ditched\nbefore somebody say don't fuck with Rich\nIt's evidential the Presedential's up on the wrist\nwho that new nigga from Oakland\nwith that brand new twist\nDon't even worry 'bout it\nwatch yo' neck & chest\nthey don't wanna get\nElliott like Mr. Nest\nKnown for flippin' scripts sick duets & mic' rips\nbut now I'm off the hook don't trip\nHookers throw yo' skirt up\nCruddies throw yo' turf up\nhustlers trust her & some of them put that work up\n'Cause if they ridin' they gone ride tonight\nwhen they hit it we to the next light.
