Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\n\n[Verse 2: Rachel]\nI was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\nThat much is true\nBut even then I knew I'd find a much better place\nEither with or without you\nThe five years we have had have been such good times\nI still love you\nBut now I think it's time I lived my life on my own\nI guess it's just what I must do\n\n[Hook: Rachel & Blaine]\nDon't, don't you want me?\nYou know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me\nDon't, don't you want me?\nYou know I don't believe it when you say that you don't need me\n\n[Chorus: Rachel, Blaine]\nIt's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind\nYou'd better change it back or we will both be sorry\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\n(oooh oh oooh oh oooh oh oooh oooh)\n\n[Outro: Rachel & Blaine]\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?\nDon't you want me, baby?"}
