And I'm so sorry \nI cannot sleep\nI cannot dream tonight \nI need somebody and always \nThis sick strange darkness \nComes creeping on so haunting every time \nAnd as I stared, I counted \nWebs from all the spiders \nCatching things and eating their insides \nLike indecision to call you \nAnd hear your voice of treason \nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight \nStop this pain tonight \n\nDon't waste your time on me you're already\nThe voice inside my head\n( I miss you, I miss you) \nDon't waste your time on me you're already \nThe voice inside my head\n(I miss you, I miss you) \n\nDon't waste your time on me you're already \nThe voice inside my head\n(I miss you I miss you) \nDon't waste your time on me you're already \nThe voice inside my head\n(I miss you I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me you're already \nThe voice inside my head\n(I miss you I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me you're already \nThe voice inside my head\n(I miss you I miss you)"}
