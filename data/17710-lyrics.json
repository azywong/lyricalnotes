Release the pain. Cry for help.\n\nCry for help is all I need.\nAll I need is a cry for help.\nCry for help is all I need.\nAll I need is a cry for help.\n\nWhy must we hide emotions?\nWhy can't we ever break down and cry?\nAll that I need is to cry for help.\nI will be there when you cry for help.\nWhy don't I hear her cry for help?\n\nAll that I need is to cry for help.\nSomebody please hear me cry for help.\nAll I can do is cry for help.\n\nAll that I need is to cry for help.\nI will be there when you cry for help.\nIs it so hard to cry for help?\n\n(Cry for help is all I need.) No need to feel ashamed.\n(All I need is a cry for help.) Come on and release the pain.\n(Cry for help is all I need.) Put your trust in me.\n(All I need is a cry for help.) My love is gonna set you free.\n\nWoooooooooooooo."}
