not\" ~Static~\n\nSome beleive in love and some beleive in friends\nBut niggaz like me beleive in making ends\nCause even when your bitch wants to trick around\nYou know the moneys got you safe and sound\n\nNow i'm bout to take it back to 84,when I was 14\nKickin back in the trees\nWestside if you please\nAnd 436 west spruce was the spot\nWith me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock,\nDonzelly if ya with me than let that shit kick\nIf your head aint spinning from dippin all them sticks\nCause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie\nScreaming \"HORALE ESE\" with them laces on a caddy\nAnd you could'nt deny\nA hit from that buddah tye\nGoing round and round the driveway\nNow it's coming my way\nAnd i'm zoned out at a young age\nAnd the whole spruce street was my stage\nPeep now back then I was in the 8th grade steady\nBut niggaz my age was getting paid already\nYeah like that nigga Zam or even young Blue\nThey made they first million by the age of 22\nLike Dan from Cedar block him and little Motor\nJames from Piru street with them boulders\nRest in peace little Noopy he did'nt have to brag\nRollin to the 10 grade in a fint 0 rag\nWell Goddamn how can I be down?\nI ask my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around.\nNigga they don't sell dope it sells itself\nWhile they kickback and just collect the wealth\nAnd now i'm thinking ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis\nT-shirt dingy, prowings tackie\nThis could be a way to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned\nRight then is when I learned that\n\n(chorus)\nSome believe in Jesus\nsome believe in Allah\nBut niggaz like me believe im making dollars\nCause even when yo niggaz wanna be untrue\nYou know the money's still good to you\n\nYes Yes\n\nSome believe in love and some believe in friends\nBut niggaz like me believe in making ends\nCause even when yo bitch wants to trick around\nYou know the moneys got you safe and sound\n\nPeep I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact\nSo instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack\nNow she jump in the regal and said i'll be right back\nWhen she came in she put me down with a plastic sack\nI turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit\nI'm keepin my rocks in the house and not in my pocket\nSister Jackie in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda,\nFresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders\nChecking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks\nDonzelly dippin sticks went and bought um a 6\nAnd 500 block peach running thangs ya see\nMoving gallon after gallon and key after key\nI'm telling you I done seen it all\nFrom niggaz hitting the sherman and the passout on the wall\nFrom cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let there panies fall\nTeeth rotten hair gone,\nand whole checks get blown\nBut then i'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam\nSaved them, splitting rocks,\nto the um tic toc\nI went from wearing khakis to Sergio Teccini\nWhile my rocks is disappearing like the great Whodini\nI bought a gang of clothes, all of my equiptment\nAnd getting somthing new with each and every shipment\nMoney gets made and money gets spent\nand how these jealous niggaz acting only makes it evident that\n\n(chorus)\nSome believe in Jesus\nsome believe in Allah\nBut niggaz like me believe im making dollars\nCause even when yo niggaz wanna be untrue\nYou know the money's still good to you\n\nYes Yes\n\nSome believe in love and some believe in friends\nBut niggaz like me believe in making ends\nCause even when yo bitch wants to trick around\nYou know the moneys got you safe and sound\n\nCheck now in 1988 I moved away to L.A.\nMy niggaz Playa Ham and Gina gave me a place to stay\nOn my way up from bottom rock\nBitches starting to jock\nCause my hair is getting longer\nAnd games getting stronger\nTo pull my on weight I went and got me a job\nBut by then Ham and Gina really started  to squab\nAbout weather I should go or stay\nShe told him either he goes or you go we both was on our way\nSo he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning,\nclowning with playas all around me just astounding\nMy nigga pimpin Carl got staring  with that hair an\nRolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren\nShaby blue feathered as he swerved\nIn the El Co p-6 park away from the curve\nBig Jam L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicki on the bike\nThat nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed\nAnd hoes just come and go in and out\nRevolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth\nI'm making a living of pimpin so you fools can't trip\nCause even though I love God I also love my grip\n\n(chorus)\nSome believe in Jesus\nsome believe in Allah\nBut niggaz like me believe im making dollars\nCause even when yo niggaz wanna be untrue\nYou know the money's still good to you\n\nYes Yes\n\nSome believe in love and some believe in friends\nBut niggaz like me believe in making ends\nCause even when yo bitch wants to trick around\nYou know the moneys got you safe and sound\n\n(talk box)\n\noooooooooooooo,ooooooooooooooooooo yeah\nsafe and sound yeah\nsafe and sound baby\nooooooooooooooo,ooooooooooooooooooo yeah\nsafe
