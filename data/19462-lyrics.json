Boogie leather ready to wreck a nigga whenever\nWhat I need is that scholar that could capitalize my dollar\nCapital size when ya hit it make me wanna holler\nI do run run my mouthpiece with a vengeance\nStart repenting if you didn't in the beginning\nYou should hit your knees, and do whatever pleases you\nLong as you pleasing me I'm all you need nigga\nThe decoy watch Brat kill and destroy\nYou the last one to fuck with So So Def and Bad Boy\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need no one else but you\nTell me what you want me to do\nI don't need no one else but you\nYou gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true\n\n[Break]\nI don't need no one baby, as long as I have you\nYou gotta believe me baby, 'cos what I say is true\nI don't need no one baby, you're the only one for me\nI don't need nobody else, baby can't you see?"}
