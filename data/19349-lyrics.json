It's plain to see we're over,\nAnd I hate when things are over,\nWhen so much is left undone.\n\nAnd I said, \"What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'\"\nShe said, \"I think I, remember that film,\nAnd, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it,\"\nAnd I said, \"Well that's, the one thing we got.\"\n\nYou'll say, that we've got nothing in common,\nNo common ground to start from,\nAnd we're falling apart,\nYou'll say the world has come between us,\nOur lives have come between us,\nStill I know you just don't care.\n\nAnd I said, \"What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'\"\nShe said, \"I think I, remember that film,\nAnd, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it,\"\nAnd I said, \"Well that's, the one thing we got.\"\n\nOooooo\n\nAnd I said, \"What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'\"\nShe said, \"I think I, remember that film,\nAnd, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it,\"\nAnd I said, \"Well that's, the one thing we got.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'\"\nShe said, \"I think I, remember that film,\nAnd, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it,\"\nAnd I said, \"Well that's, the one thing we got.\"\n"}
