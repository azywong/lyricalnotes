That's exactly where I lost it.\nSee that line. Well I never should have crossed it.\nStop right there. Well I never should have said \nthat it's the very moment that\nI wish that I could take back.\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for the person I became.\nI'm sorry that it took so long for me to change.\nI'm ready to try and never become that way \nagain\n'cause who I am hates who I've been.\nWho I am hates who I've been.\n\nI talk to absolutely no one.\nCouldn't keep to myself enough.\nAnd the things bottled inside have finally begun \nto create so much pressure that I?ll soon blow up.\n\nI heard the reverberating footsteps\nsinking up to the beating of my heart,\nand I was positive that unless I got myself together,\nI would watch me fall apart.\n\nAnd I can't let that happen again\ncause then you'll see my heart\nin the saddest state it's ever been.\n\nThis is no place to try and live my life.\n\n[Pre-Chorus x2]\n[Chorus]\n\nWho I am hates who I've been\nand who I am won't take the second chance you gave me.\nWho I am hates who I've been\n'cause who I've been only ever made me...\n\nSo sorry for the person I became.\nSo sorry that it took so long for me to change.\nI'm ready to try and never become that way again\n'cause who I am hates who I've been.\nWho I am hates who I've been."}
