Where'd you go?\nDaddy, can't you tell?\nI'm not trying to fake it\nAnd I ain't the one to blame\nThere's no one home\nIn my house of pain\nI didn't write these pages\nAnd my script's been rearranged\nNo, there's no one home\nIn my house of pain\nWasn't I worth the time?\nA boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime and all the time\nI looked up to you\nI paced my room a million times\nAnd all I ever got was on big line, the same old lie\nHow could you?\nWell, I was eighteen and still talking to myself\nWhere were you? Where'd you go?\nDaddy can't you tell?\nI'm not trying to fake it\nAnd I ain't the one to blame\nThere's no one home\nIn my house of pain\nI didn't write these pages\nAnd my script's been rearranged\nNo, there's no one home\nIn my house of pain\nAnd I'm alone again\nWell, if I learned anything from this...it's how to live on my own"}
