Kelly Featuring Ronald Isley","spotify_id":"6zA2SEJJoiNByVMlQ4vgtH","lyrics":"Listen girl you want me but he needs you\nYet you're tellin' me that everything is cool\nTryin' to convince me baby to do as you say\nJust go along and see things your way\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd keep it on the down low, nobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low, nobody has to know\n\nSecret lovers is what you wanna be\nWhile making love to him, girl you're silently calling on me\nWhat is a man to do in a situation like this?\nI feel there is something that I don't wanna miss\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nBeautiful you are but you're his by far\nComin' by my way drivin' his fancy car\nMaking plans to be in my life forever\nTell me, tell me that we'll always be together\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nListen babe I won't whisper a word"}
