Dawn - The Ways of the Wind\n\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\n\nI wore a ring that was taken so hastily\nThinking naively that it guaranteed my safety\nI'm looking at eyes that have stumbled across a shooting star\nSaying that's alright, I know the kind of man you are\n\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\n\nHow many things I recall I can't take too far\nShe's good at collecting\nAnd counting on the things you are\nForever racing the flames she loved to put me through\nI was never a good seahorse\nBut I can practice rides on you\nAnother world, another space\nAnother mind insists I'm crying\nI once experienced time with you\nNow a ll exists through rage and sighing\nSimon says I love you\nBut not as much as you display\nWho says its alright\nThen Simon says she's yesterday\n\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nLike holding on a Nova Star\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nThe constant search for who you are\n\nOh, life\n\nUnderneath love's theme lies a superficial chain\nWhatever seduced the barrier\nThinks everything should stay the same\nI'm meeting mind say\nHi I think I love you\nI never used to run from love\nBut calculate what I've been through\nWhatever love, whatever vibe\nWhenever I'm convinced you're lying\nAsk me for my mind and I\nWill ask you why your sighs are dying\nIntroduce the melancholy\nI've felt since last I saw you\nYou say it's alright\nBut I'm crushed till it decides upon you\n\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nI only hope you'll understand\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nFinding you've no place to stand\n\nSend my deepest sympathy\nTo the flowers of December's garden\nWhat's for sale of you're emotions\nTell me. Trust can't buy me love\nWell, that's OK\nTell me of your adventures, you know\nI bet I could survive the wind if\nCuriosity's killed the snow for real\n\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nLike holding on a Nova Star\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nThe constant search for who you are\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nLike holding on a Nova Star\nHolding on is like the ways of the wind\nFinding a place to stand"}
