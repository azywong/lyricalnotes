White) \nProducer: Dan Hartman \nAlbums:Foreign Affair (89), Simply The Best (91), The Collected Recordings (94) \n\nI was thinking about parking the other night \nWe was out on a back road \nMe and my baby was just getting right \nAll our systems on overload \nRadio blasting in the front seat \nTurning out the music fine \nAnd we was snuggled up in the back seat \nMaking up for lost time \n\nSteamy windows \nZero visibility \nSteamy windows \nComing from the body heat \n\nYou can wine and dine with a man all night \nWith good intent \nBut there is something about a confrontation on a back road \nBreaks down the difference \n\nSteamy windows \nZero visibility \nSteamy windows \nComing from the body heat \n\nSteamy windows \nAin't nobody can see \nSteamy windows \nComing from the body heat \nThere's a sound outside the front door \nAnd I know that's just the wind \nAnd it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer \nAnd start things happening again \n\nSteamy windows \nAin't nobody can see \nSteamy windows \nComing from the body heat"}
