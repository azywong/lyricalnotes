It moved beneath my feet.\nIn the form of a morning paper. Laid out for me to see.\n\nSaw his face in a corner picture. I recognized the name.\nCould not stop staring at the. Face I'd never see again.\n\nIt's a shame to awake in a world of pain\nWhat does it mean when a war has taken over\n\nIt's the same everyday in a hell manmade\nWhat can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?\n\nThe whole world...World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nThe whole world...World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nMedals on a wooden mantle. Next to a handsome face.\nThat the president took for granted.\nWriting checks that others pay.\n\nAnd in all the madness. Thought becomes numb and naive.\nSo much to talk about. Nothing for to say.\n\nIt's the same everyday and the wave won't break\nTell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder\n\nLaying claim to the take that our soldiers save\nDoes not equate, and the truth's already out there\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nLooking in the eyes of the fallen\nYou got to know there's another, another, another, another\nAnother way\n\nIt's a shame to awake in a world of pain\nWhat does it mean when a war has taken over\n\nIt's the same everyday and the wave won't break\nTell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide.\n\nThe whole world,... World over.\nIt's a worldwide suicide."}
