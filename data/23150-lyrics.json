Hold on tight!\r\nAnd this is the dream\r\nIt's all I need!\r\nYou never know where you'll find it\r\nAnd I'm gonna take my time, yeah\r\nI'm still getting it right\r\nThis is the Life\r\n\r\nTakin' in a whole new scene\r\nAnd I'm swimming with a new crowd (crowd)\r\nBreakin' down the old four walls\r\nAnd building them up from the ground\r\nI love how it feels right now\r\n\r\nThis is the life! (life!)\r\nHold on tight! (hold on, hold on!)\r\nAnd this is the dream! (dream!)\r\nIt's all I need!
