I'll never forget\nTouchin' your body all soakin' wet\nThe water was cool, the feelin' was hot\nKissin' on you while the ocean rocked\nIn your strapless sundress\nKickin' back, no stress\nAs long as we was together\nCause we were feelin' young love\nAnd we couldn't get enough\nBaby, I could reminisce forever\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd now I'm like\nHey, girl, don't you know I miss it?\nAnd I wonder if you miss it too?\nNever thought it would end 'til it did\nNow, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'about you\n\n[Chorus]\nI think about you in the summertime\nAnd all the good times we had, baby\nBeen a few years and I can't deny\nThe thought of you still makes me crazy\nI think about you in the summertime\nI'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind\nMy summertime\n\n[Bridge]\n(Break it down)\nSummer ended, winter started\nIt got colder when we parted ways\n(I like this part)\nAs the seasons change\n(Now bring it, bring it back)\nWinter melted, spring, I felt it\nSummertime will never be the same\nWithout you, my summertime\nMy summertime\n\n[Chorus]\nI think about you in the summertime\nAnd all the good times we had, baby\nBeen a few years and I can't deny\nThe thought of you still makes me crazy\nI think about you in the summertime\nI'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind\nMy summertime"}
