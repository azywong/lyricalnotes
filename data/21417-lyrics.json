Fundamental differing\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion\nDisintegrating as it goes testing our communication\nThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so\nWe cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication\n\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down\nNo fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to\nPoint the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\n\nThe poetry that comes from the squaring off between\nAnd the circling is worth it\nFinding beauty in the dissonance\n\nThere was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away\nMildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting\nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing\nDoomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication\n\nCold silence has a tendency to atrophy any\nSense of compassion\nBetween supposed lovers\nBetween supposed brothers\nI know the pieces fit [8x]\n"}
