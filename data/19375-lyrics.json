A telephone call today. \nSomebody’s offering a job a thousand miles away, \nAnd I want to take it, it’s the opportunity of a life time, \nBut I need a second opinion, an opinion other than mine. \n\nSo I, I’m turning to you, \nBecause you always seem to know what to do. \nWhen times like these arrive, I call, \nOn my only true friend in the world, my girl.\n\nSo I, I want to know, \nShould I really, really go,\nAnd if so, Are you coming with me? \nI, I got to know, \nIf you really want me to go, \nAnd if so, Come with me.\n\nI never wanted anything as much as I want you with me. \nYou were the one who said to follow my dreams, \nOf having a house, a car, a view of the stars, and a beautiful wife, \nSo I need someone I can go with, \nI need some love in my life.\n\nSo I, I’m turning to you, \nBecause you always seem to know what to do. \nWhen times like these arrive, I call, \nOn the only real love of my life, you are my life.\n\nI want to know, \nShould I really, really go,\nAnd if so, Are you coming with me? \nSo I, I got to know, \nIf you really want me to go, \nAnd if so, Come with me.\n\nI need you to\ncome with me"}
