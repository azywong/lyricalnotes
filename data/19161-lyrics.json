Hold on to me.\r\nHold on, everything's gonna be alright. Just hold on to me tonight.\r\n\r\nAnything that hurts you hurts me too.\r\nI'm not gonna let your world turn blue.\r\nWill you take my hand and feel how close I am.\r\nThere ain't nothin' I won't do for you.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nI know the world can drive you to your knees, but when you need to cry,\r\nbaby, cry to me.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)"}
