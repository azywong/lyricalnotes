Right here\nKiss both your lips and rubin' those thighs\nTaste your wine\nLet me taste you baby, ahh\n\nI can do it soft or I can do it hard\nI can make you scream if you let down your guard my baby\nIt's not too far from here to extasy\nI know you want good lovin\nSo lay your body next to me\n\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up, do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumpin every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up, do you up baby\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\n\nSlow moving in your body\nFeels like I'm gonna be in here all night\nAnd when the love is rolling\nStart coming without stop\nFilled to the brim\nI'm gonna trip down to the very last drop\n\nAnd if ain't good enough for you baby\nI'll do it all for you\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up, do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\n\nIf ain't good enough then I'll work harder\nTurn it up I'll please you darlin'\nDo it up, do it up just for you\nAnd baby I'll taste the wine and give you pleasure\nClose the door I'll do whatever\nTill I know you're hot\n\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up, do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumpin every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up, do you up baby\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough, good enough baby..."}
