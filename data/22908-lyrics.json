Let go\nTill you shed your pride, and you climb to heaven\nAnd you throw yourself off\nNow you're out there spinning...\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\n\nAnd now you're out there spinning...\nAnd now you're out there spinning...\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\n\nIn the silence\nAll your secrets\nRaise their weary heads\nAnd you can't pin yourself\nBack together\nWith who you thought you were\nNow you're out there livin'...\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\n\nIn the deep...\n\nNow you're out there spinning...\nNow you're out there swimming...\nNow you're out there spinning...\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep\nIn the deep..."}
