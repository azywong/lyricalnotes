beat is kinda soothin' to the ear\nYo', I give you what you wanna hear\nI could make you dance and make you shout\n'Cause I'm all about the M-O-N-E-Y, without a doubt\nAnd I won't stop until I make you rock\nSo understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance, dance\n\nThe beat is on, you know it's hittin'\nGet on the floor, don't wanna see nobody sittin'\n'Cause I go and flow when I'm on the mic\nMake you dance and do what you like\nIt's a simple calculation like one and one is two\nI don't do this all for me, I do it all for you\nAnd I won't stop until I make you rock\nSo understand that I can make you dance\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your mind\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your mind\n\n\"Bass\"\n\"Bass\"\n\"Bass\"\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nI'm a powerful force, of course my lyrics runnin' like a race horce\nStrong and fast, don't try to pass, got no way, you'll never last\nWith the speed I'm usin', sellin' fresh rhymes is what I'm provin'\nTo be raw, like you never saw, music up to par\nAnd I won't stop until I make you rock\nSo understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance\n\nI'm a rappin' educator, bustin' rhyme devastator\nLike a clock likes to tock, bust a rap and a rock\nFrom the day to the night, there's a rhyme I do recite\nAnd I know you had no clue when I say what I do\nSo I slow down just a bit\nTo give enough time to let you hit your cigarette\nAnd I won't stop until I make you rock\nSo understand that I can make you dance\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your mind\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your mind\n\n\"Here's one that's cool, crazy, improved, super...\"\n\"...And sincerely yours\n\n\"Yeah, boy!\"\n\nThey call me B.G., so listen to my story\nI'm not a playboy, but girls adore me\nRomeo is dead, B.G. is live\nI keep on rockin' till I say, bye-bye\nI didn't come to teach, but you listen, you learn\nYour beat, your ears, your body just yearns\nFor more of the muse score and the rap\nAllow me to make you clap and dance, dance, dance\n\nI'm a terminator, innovator, battle me, eliminator\nMake you hot, make you sweat, make emcees get upset\nTake control of your soul, make your body wanna roll\nDo the type of hype, you like what I write\nNever bite, only excite to highest height\n'Cause I can do it right\n(When I'm on the mic)\nAnd I won't stop until I make you rock\nSo understand that I can make you dance\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your mind\n\nThis beat is hot!\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nGet, get, get into the rhythm\nGet up, get into the rhythm\nMake up your
