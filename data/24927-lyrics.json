(let's go!)\nSee the way we on and then we all up in the race\nAnd you know we gotta go\nDon't try to keep up with the pace\nAnd we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in\nAnd we always gotta do it, take it to another place\nGotta taste it, and I gotta grab it\nAnd I gotta cut all through this traffic\nJust to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it\n\n[Hook: Chris Brown]\nLook at me now, look at me now (oh)\nI’m gettin' paper\nLook at me now (oh) look at me now (yeah)\nFresher than a muh'fucka\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]\nMan, fuck these bitch-ass niggas! How y’all doin'?\nI’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance\nI go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges\nI don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit\nNo, I’m pollution, no substitution\nGot a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy\nI never gave a fuck about a hater\nGot money on my radar, dressed like a skater\nGot a big house, came with a elevator\nYou niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter\nMarley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay\nIf you wanted bullshit, then I’m like, \"¡Olé!\"\nI don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak\nYour girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil\nThat’s word to my flag, and my flag red\nI’m out of my head, bitch\nI’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb\nYou ain’t hotter than mine\nNope, not on my time, and I’m not even tryin'\nWhat's poppin', slime? Nothin', five\nAnd if they trippin’, fuck ‘em, five\nI ain’t got no time to shuck and jive\nThese niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie\nCîroc and Sprite on a private flight\nBitch, I been tight since Guiding Light\nAnd my pockets right, and my diamonds white\nAnd my momma's nice, and my daddy’s dead\nYou faggots scared ‘cause I’m too wild\nBeen here for a while, I was like \"fuck trial\"\nI puts it down, I’m so Young Money\nIf you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!\n\n[Hook: Chris Brown]\nLook at me now, look at me now (oh)\nI’m gettin' paper\nLook at me now (oh) look at me now (yeah)\nFresher than a muh'fucka\n\n[Outro: Chris Brown]\nOkay\nOkay\nIs that right?\nI’m fresher than a muh'fucka!"}
