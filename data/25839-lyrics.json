Oh I just gotta see what you're wearin'\nYour hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?\nOh I just have to see it now\n\nIf you wanna call me, call me, call me\nYou don't have to worry 'bout it baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that's all right\nThis is a drop everything kinda thing\nSwing on by, I'll pour you a drink\nThe door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights\nBaby you can crash my party anytime\n\nAin't a spot down town that's rockin' the way that you rock me\nAin't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do\nI could be on the front row \nof the best show and look down \nand see your face on my phone\nAnd I'm gone, so long, hang on\n I'll meet you in a minute or two\n\nIf you wanna call me, call me, call me\nYou don't have to worry 'bout it baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that's all right\nThis is a drop everything kinda thing\nSwing on by, I'll pour you a drink\nThe door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights\nBaby you can crash my party anytime\n\nIf it's 2 in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely \nand wonderin' what I'm doin'\n\nGo ahead and call me, call me, call me\nYou don't have to worry 'bout it baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that's all right\nThis is a drop everything kinda thing\nSwing on by, I'll pour you a drink\nThe door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights\nBaby you can crash my party anytime\n\nBaby you can crash my party anytime"}
