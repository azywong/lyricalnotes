Ain't no way to help it\nGirl you got me hooked on your love\nOh no! How can I quit it?\nWhen I can't ever never get enough\n\nI'm a slave to the habit\nSlave to the habit\nChained to the way you do that thing you do\nIm a stone cold addict\nYou know I gots to have it\nI'm a slave to the habit of loving you"}
