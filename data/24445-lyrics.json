I look at you \nWhen the waves are flooding the shore \nAnd I can't find my way home anymore \nThat's when I,\nI... I look at you \n\nWhen I look at you.. \nI see forgiveness \nI see the truth \nYou love me for who I am \nLike the stars hold the moon \nRight there where they belong \nAnd I know I'm not alone \n\nYeah \n\nWhen my world is falling apart \nWhen there's no light to break up the dark \nThat's when I,\nI... I look at you \nWhen the waves are flooding the shore \nAnd I can't find my way home anymore \nThat's when I,\nI...

I look at you \nI look at you \n\nYeah yeah...\nOh oh...\nYou appear just like a dream to me..."}
