{"song_name":"I ll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me)","artist_id":302003,"display_artist":"Expose","spotify_id":"44qy6ywloZIkMPOMOZzm05","lyrics":"I hear you're taking the town again\nHaving a good time\nWith all your good time friends\nI don't think that you think of me\nYou're on your own now\nAnd I'm alone and free\nI know that I should get on with my life\nBut a life lived without you could never be right\n\nAs long as the stars shine down from the heavens\nLong as the rivers run to the sea\nI'll never get over you gettin' over me\n\nI try to smile so the hurt won't show\nTell everybody\nThat I was glad to see you go\nBut the tears just won't go away (won't go away)\nLonliness found me\nLooks like it's here to stay\nI know that I ought to find someone new\nBut all I find is myself always thinkin' of you\n\nAs long as the stars shine down from the heavens\nLong as the rivers run to the sea\nI'll never get over you gettin' over me\n\nOh... No matter what I do\nEach night's a lifetime to live through\nI can't go on like this. (I need your touch)\nYou're the only one I ever loved... oh\n\nAnd as long as the stars shine down from the heavens\nLong as the rivers run to the sea\nI'll never get over you gettin' over me\nI'll never get over you gettin over\nNever get over you... gettin over\nI'll never get over you gettin' over me"}
