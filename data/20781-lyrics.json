Did I stop giving?\nCan't put my finger on, what went wrong\nNow the quietest noise I'm told is the sound of letting go\nCould've heard a teardrop, could've heard a heartbreak\nNever saw the flood come even though I felt the rain\nNever heard a house sound so loud with memories\nWhere there used to be a happy home\nIn the house on the corner of lonely and gone\nWhoa, never heard a house sound so loud with memories\nWhere there used to be a happy home in the house on the corner\nIn the house on the corner of lonely and gone"}
