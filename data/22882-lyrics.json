You...\n\nI don't know anymore\nWhat it's for\nI'm not even sure\nIf there's anyone who is in the sun\nWill you help me to understand\n\n'Cause I been caught in between all you wish for and all you need\nMaybe you're not even sure what it's for\nAny more than me...\n\nMay god's love be with you\nAlways\nMay god's love be with you\nAlways, Always\nMay god's love be with you\n\n'Cause if I find\nIf I find my own way\nHow much will I find, if I find\nIf I find my own way\nHow much will I find, if I find\nIf I find my own way\nHow much will I find you...\nYou\nI found you... You\nOh, I found you... You\nOh, I found you..."}
