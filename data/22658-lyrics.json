I'll be ready to party (whoa, yeah!)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\nKeep the top on drop while the girls looking hot, hit the volo and we just dont stop\r\nParty until the morning light (whoa)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\n\r\nVerse I\r\nI just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome,\r\nCall the ruca on the phone, let her know Im home alone, Its seven thirty and the sun is going down,\r\nIts a summer night and the fun is going down,I picked her up and she looks all dolled up (She looks good),\r\nSitting passenger in my rag Impala (yeah),I let her know she looks beautiful to me,the world's an ugly place,but she is such a sight to see,\r\nThe kind of woman that would put up a fight for me,\r\nThe kind that wants to spend summer nights with me,\r\nThe temp was eighty and Im cruising with my lady,\r\nPlaying some Ralphie Pagan, Ohh Baby Baby,\r\nI see my home boys and they're crusing in their rides (Yo was up homes),\r\nWith their ladies sitting by their side,\r\nPeople think we look crazy, but I think we look classy,\r\nBut then again thats only if you ask me\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nSummer days just sitting around, but when the sun goes down... I'll be ready to party (whoa, yeah!)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\nKeep the top on drop while the girls looking hot, hit the volo and we just dont stop,Party untill the morning light (whoa)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (ohh)\r\n\r\nVerse II\r\nMy home boys throwing a back yard boogie,\r\nSo every body gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time,\r\nThe dj is spinning so I grab the mic and be like,Aint nothing like them summer nights,\r\nThe party is packed with beautiful woman and the gang of the homies that want to get with them,\r\nAnd theyll say anything just to hit em,\r\nAnd its usually a nice summer night when they did em,\r\nI dont know, it must be something in the air,\r\nCant help but have a good time, because the feeling is there,\r\nTo some people the feeling is rare,They're at their pad saying God dam I wish I was there,\r\nTo have a drink, have a toke and hook up,With some one fine but the kind that looks up,\r\nGot to keep some pisto in the cup,\r\nParty until the sun comes up and we give up\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nSummer days just sitting around, but when the sun goes down... I'll be ready to party (whoa, yeah!)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\nKeep the top on drop while the girls looking hot, hit the volo and we just dont stop\r\nParty untill the morning light (whoa)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\n\r\nVerse III\r\nThem summer nights can keep a smile on your face,\r\nGotta try to have a good time with your life otherwise it's just a waste,\r\nEither way Im gonna party just in case,\r\nLike Prince partied like it was 99, in 87, 88,I couldnt ask for no better weather,\r\nIm right next to the Pacific to be specific,The candy paint job glows under the moon light,\r\nAs I close out my summer night and say good night,\r\nIts time to put the top up and park it, drop it,\r\nUnplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it,\r\nWalk in the pad and fall into bed,\r\nAs she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head,And we do this all night long,From dusk till dawn,But its not the quite the same when summer nights are gone,\r\nBut even when they're gone, it wont be long,\r\nEight more months and once again its on\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nSummer days just sitting around, but when the sun goes down... I'll be ready to party (whoa, yeah!)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)\r\nKeep the top on drop while the girls looking hot, hit the volo and we just dont stop\r\nParty untill the morning light (whoa)\r\nAint nothing like them summer nights (Ohh)"}
