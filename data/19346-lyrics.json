Mmmmhhhhmmmmm!\n\nJust a minute and I can tell you about the things that don't need to be\nHere we are at the place where it all began, people can’t you see\nThought you knew about the west side, east side Gs on the creep and go\nOnly living for the day, never worried about tomorrow\nAlways tripping, now we're slipping, ladies bitching, babies missing\nFrom the evils of the world\n\nThey been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nWe keep spending most of our lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\n\nPower and the money, money is the power, ain't a damn thing funny, this is a jack-up (fool) don't you holler\nCause I don't have that long and I know that it's wrong, but I live by the G's rules and it's on\nSo don't you trip, 'cause I won't slip, I keep my Gs by my side and my thing on my hip\nSo don't you creep by my 'hood without your heat or it's the grim reaper that you’re sure to meet\nAin't no gangstas living in paradise\nAin't no gangstas living in paradise\nTell me why are we so blind to see\nThat the ones we hurt are you and me\n\nThey been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nWe keep spending most of our lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\n\nNow here’s another that comes to mind, 'bout a sister that put herself in a bind\nShe keeps praying on the day that her man would come home from prison to stay\nThe life she’s livin', The love she’s givin'\nThe pain is killin', The stress she’s feelin'\nFrom the evils of the world\n\nThey been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nWe keep spending most of our lives living in the gangsta's paradise\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\nEh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm\n\nTell me why are we so blind to see\nThat the ones we hurt are you and me\nTell me why are we so blind to see\nThat the ones we hurt are you and me\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\nAin’t no gangstas living in paradise\n(fade out)"}
