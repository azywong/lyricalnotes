The hammock by the doorway we spent time in,\r\nSwings empty,\r\ndon't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me,\r\nI wonder\r\n\r\nHow's it going to be, When it goes down,\r\nHow's it going to be, When you're not around,\r\nHow's it going to be, When you find out there was nothing,\r\nBetween you and me, 'Cause I don't care,\r\nHow's it going to be,\r\n\r\nHow's it going to be\r\nWhen you don't know me, any more\r\nAnd How's it going to be\r\n\r\nWant to get myself back in again,\r\nThe soft dive of oblivion.\r\nWant to taste the salt of your skin\r\nThe soft dive of oblivion, oblivion\r\n\r\nHow's it going to be,\r\nWhen you don't know me, anymore,\r\nHow's it going to be,\r\nHow's it going to be,\r\nHow's it going to be."}
