Woods] \nDon't you dare tell me we gotta let it go? \nWe been on top for too long just to let it go under \nI don't wanna hear that \nI just can't hear that \nand know \nWherever you wanna take me \nI'll go \nI been with you for too long to start over with another \nI know that you hear me \nJust tell me you hear me \n\n[Chorus w/ Ad-libs (D. Woods) \n\n[Outro Ad Libs]"}
