Hands Up!\nHere's another one... and a... and a... another one\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) Why you all in my ear?\nTalkin' a whole bunch a sh*t that I ain't tryin to hear\nGet Back! You don't know me like that\nGet back! You don't know me like that!\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) I ain't playin' around\nMake one false move, I'll take you down\nGet back! You don't know me like that\nGet back motherfucker! You don't know me like that!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo, so, come on, come on\nDON'T get swung on, swung on\nIt's the knick-knack-patty-whack still riding cadillacs\nFamily off the streets\nmade my homies put the baggies back\n(Whoo!) Still snaggin' plaques (yep)\nstill action-packed (yep), and\ndope... i keep it flippin' like acrobats\nThat's why I pack a mack, that'll crack a back\ncause on my waist, there's more heat than the shaq-attack!\nBut I ain't speakin' about ballin'\njus' thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start ballin'\nWe all in together now, birds of the feather now\njus' bought a plane so we change in the weather now\nSo put your brakes on, cats put your capes on\nand knock off your block, get dropped\nand have your face blown\nCause I'll prove it, scratch off\nthe music, like hey little stupid, don't make me lose it!\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) Why you all in my ear?\nTalkin' a whole bunch a sh*t that I ain't tryin to hear\nGet Back! You don't know me like that\nGet back! You don't know me like that!\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) I ain't playin' around\nMake one false move, I'll take you down\nGet back! You don't know me like that\nGet back motherfucker! You don't know me like that!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI came (I came), I saw (I saw)\nI hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw) . [x4]\n\nSee I caught him with a right hook, caught him with a jab\ncaught him with an upper cut, kicked him in his ass\nSent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk\nand no trips to the county\nI ain't for that walk! We split like 2 pins at the end of a lane\nwe'll knock out your spotlight\nand put indian fangs\nHolding DTP pinned at the end of yo' chain, and put\nthe booty of a swish at the end of a flaamme\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) Why you all in my ear?\nTalkin' a whole bunch a sh*t that I ain't tryin to hear\nGet Back! You don't know me like that\nGet back! You don't know me like that!\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) I ain't playin' around\nMake one false move, I'll take you down\nGet back! You don't know me like that\nGet back motherfucker! You don't know me like that!\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey, you want WHAT with me?\nI'm gonna tell you one time, don't F*CK with me!\nGet down! Beat his ass... ain't got nothin'\nto lose, and i'm havin a bad day\ndon't make me take it out on you! [x2]\n\nMaann, cause I don't wanna do that\nI wanna have a good time and enjoy my drink\nsit back and watch some women get drunk\nas hell, so I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell\nI know it's been a little while\nsince I've been out the house, but now I'm here\nyou wanna stand around runnin' yo' mouth?\nI can't hear nothing you sayin' or spittin', so what's up?\nDon't you see we in the club? man shut the f*ck up!\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) Why you all in my ear?\nTalkin' a whole bunch a sh*t that I ain't tryin to hear\nGet Back! You don't know me like that\nGet back! You don't know me like that!\n(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) I ain't playin' around\nMake one false move, I'll take you down\nGet back! You don't know me like that\nGet back motherfucker! You don't know me like that!\n\n[Outro]\nAh! We in the red light district!\nAh! We in the red light district!\nWhoo! We in the red light district!\nAh! We in the red light district!\nWhoo! We in the red light district!\nWhoo! The red light district!\nWhoo! The red light district\nAh! The red light district"}
