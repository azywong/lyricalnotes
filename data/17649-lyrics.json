You, '90 is my year. \n\nPlay that funky music \nPlay that funky music, white boy \nPlay that funky music                                Come on, Come on, I \nPlay that funky music white boy                    can't hear you \n\nYou're weakenin' fast, Yo! and I can tell it \nYour body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it \nSo don't be mad and don't be sad \n'Cause the lyrics belong to Ice, You can call me Dad \nYou're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure \nLet the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure \nSo come up close and don't be square \nYou wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere \n\nYou thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong \nSo come on, everybody and sing this song \n\nSay -- Play that funky music        Say, go white boy, go white boy go \n           play that funky music        Go white boy, go white boy, go \nLay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die. \n\nPlay that funky music                                Come on, Come on, let me hear \nPlay that funky music white boy                    you say it, say it \nPlay that funky music                                    A little louder now \nPlay that funky music, white boy                Come on, Come on, Come on \nPlay that funky music \n\nProduced by Vanilla Ice \nPublished by Ice Baby Music/Qpm Music (Bmi)"}
