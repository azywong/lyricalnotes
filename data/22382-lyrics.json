Where dat Yo at?\nWhere dat Thomas at? Where VL at?\nYa'll hear that nolia clap? Ya'll hear that nolia clap?\nI'm in the Calio, You know I'm headed front of town\nBy Kayotic and Lil' real one, 'cuz it's goin' down\nYou see the DB's tell â€~em Wacko lookin' for â€~em\nI got some dro, I got some change, I got some pussy for â€~em\nIf they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin' up Chuck\nIn the chromed out bubblegum pickup truck\nSlide on Josephine, holla at Lil Kia and pluck\nMy nigga Troy told me to keep it real as fuck\nWe bought the House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia\nOn Washington and Ferret, across the street from Babosca\nBut first I'm 'bout to snatch up all Saratoga\nHead straight to foot action and snatch me two pair of Solja's\nTake a left on Taladonna get a O of that doja\nTell â€~em right on my trail and hit the gars and let's roll up\nI'm bout to hit Julio and get the blazes from soda\nI got Geezy waitin' on VL we 'bout to bang up this Yola\nWhere dat Melph at? Where da Yo at?\nWhere dat Thomas at? Where VL at?\nYa'll hear that Nolia Clap? Ya'll hear that Nolia Clap?\nWhere Hollygrove at? Gert Town at?\nP Town at? Nigga Town at? Bust it!"}
