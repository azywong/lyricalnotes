There go the centurions\n\nBrutus had to turn his head\nWhen THIS cat done went and said\n\"If he's got this thing for shoes\nHe just might be ambitious, too\nThey got holidays all in his name\nAnd all a tyrant needs is fame\nThose fascists don't play pretty games\nEgypt is the place to be...\nBut Rome is a democracy\nRome!\"\n\nCaesar never got them back\n'Cause they killed his ass in the second act\nBrutus spoke, then Antony:\nSaid, \"My girlfriend's cat is smarter than me\nFriends, Romans, can't you see\nMy girlfriend's cat is smarter than me\nEgypt's biggest rivalry:\nCleopatra's cat and me.\""}
