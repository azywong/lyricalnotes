Is it you?\nNothing that I can do\nTo make you change your mind\n\nIs it me? Is it you?\nNothing that I can do\nIs it a waste of time?\n\nIs it me? Is it you?\nNothing that I can do\nto make you change your mind\n\nSo why are you running away?\nWhy are you running away?\n(What is it I have to say?)\nSo why are you running away?\n(To make you admit you're afraid)\nWhy are you running away?"}
