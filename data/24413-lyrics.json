Oh.\nAin't that the reason you're at this club. Oh. Oh.\nYou ain't gonna find a dance with him. No. Oh.\nGot a better solution for you girl. Oh. Oh.\n\nJust stay with me now. Say the word and we'll go.\nI'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.\nYou'll see a side of love you've never known.\nI can see it going down, going down.\n\nIn my head, I see you all over me.\nIn my head, you fulfill my fantasy.\nYou'll be screaming no.\nIn my head, it's going down.\nIn my head, it's going down.\nIn my head. Yeah. In my head. Oh yeah.\n\nSome dudes know all the right things to say.\nWhen it comes down to it, it's just a game.\nInstead of talking let me demonstrate. Yeah.\nGet down to business let's skip foreplay.\n\nJust leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go.\nI'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.\nYou'll see a side of love you've never known.\nI can see it going down, going down.\n\nIn my head, I see you all over me.\nIn my head, you fulfill my fantasy.\nYou'll be screaming no.\nIn my head, it's going down.\nIn my head, it's going down.\nIn my head.\n\nBreak it down. Ay-oh. Come on. Ay-oh. Ay-oh.\nYou singing to me baby in my head right now. Ay-oh.\nAy-oh. Come on.\nShe'll be screaming out when it all goes down.\n\nJust leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go. \nWe can go.\nI'll be your teacher.
