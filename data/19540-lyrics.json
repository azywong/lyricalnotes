I'll be there)\nA friendship that would never end \n(Friendship that... will never end)\nWhen you are weak (You are weak)\nI will be strong (I'll be strong)\nHelping you to carry on \n(Helping you... carry on)\nCall on me I will be there\nDon't be afraid\nPlease believe me when I say count on\n(Please believe me when I say)\n(Count on )\n\nThere's a place inside of all of us\nWhere our faith in love begins\nYou should reach to find the truth in love\nThe answers there within, ohhhh\nI know that life can make you feel\nIt's much harder than it really is\nBut we'll get through it (we'll get through it)\nJust (just) don't (don't) give in...\n\nCount on me through thick and thin (count on me)\nA friendship that would never end (It will never end)\nWhen you are weak (You)\nI will be strong (I'll be strong...)\nHelping you to carry on\nCall on me I will be there \n(call on me... I'll be there)\nDon't be afraid (Don't... be afraid now)\nPlease believe me when I say\nCount on\nCount on\nCount on\nCount on\nCount on\nCount on\nCount on me...\nOhh yes you can, I know I can, sure I can, so glad I can, so glad I can, \nCount on me."}
