O. U\nShe had to take him down easy\nAnd put a bullet in his brain\n(she left him in the pouring rain)\nShe said 'cause nobody believes me\nThe man was such a sleaze\nHe ain't never gonna be the same\n\nRun away, run away from the pain\nRun away, run away from the pain\nRun away, run away\nRun, run away\n\nJanie's got a gun\nJanie's got a gun\nJanie's got a gun\nNow everybody is on the run\nJanie's got a gun\nDog days just begun\nNow everybody is on the run\n(honey honey, what's the problem)\nJanie's got a gun (tell me it ain't right)\nJanie's got a gun (was it your daddy's cradle-robbin' that)\nDog days just begun\n(made you scream at night)\nNow everybody is on the run\nJanie's got a gun"}
