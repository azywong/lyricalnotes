I found a friend in a dog\n'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue\nMany questions, no answers, just stress\nTry to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed\nWith the curse and it gets worse as time goes by\nCan't see straight 'cause I'm so high\nWhy ask why when you know?\nNigga, when it's your time to go, you go\n\n[Hook]\nY'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy\nJust keep it real, partner, give to the needy\nRibs is touchin', so don't make me wait\nFuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate"}
