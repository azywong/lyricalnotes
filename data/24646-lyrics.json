Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na\n(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na\n\n'Cause there's so many fine women\nThat my head is spinnin'\nAnd I'm seein' double vision\nEverybody's singin' like\n(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na\n(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na, na\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet's do this outside\nShut down the whole block\nWatch the girls strut by like it's a catwalk\nWe're livin' easy\nWe got the whole day\nAnd we can go hard no matter what the cops say\n(Na, na, na)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm thinking maybe, I can't have relationships\n'Cause lately, they're not making any sense\nAnd baby, you're the one thing on my mind but that can change anytime\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there's so many fine women\nThat my head is spinnin'\nAnd I've lost all feelin'\nEverybody's singin' like\n(Hey!)
