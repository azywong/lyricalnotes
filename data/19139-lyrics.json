Soon\n\nI love you so much, can't count all the ways\nI've died for you girl and all they can say is\n\"he's not your kind\"\nThey never get tired of putting me down\nAnd I'll never know when I come around\nWhat I'm gonna find\nDon't let them make up your mind\nDon't you know...\n\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nPlease, come take my hand\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nSoon, you'll need a man\n\nI've been misunderstood for all of my life\nBut what they're saying girl it cuts like a knife\n\"the boy's no good\"\nWell I've finally found what I'm a looking for\nBut if they get their chance they'll end it for sure\nSurely would\nBaby I've done all I could\nNow it's up to you...\n\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nPlease, come take my hand\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nSoon, you'll need a man\n\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nPlease, come take my hand\nGirl, you'll be a woman soon\nSoon but soon, you'll need a man"}
