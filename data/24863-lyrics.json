Damn)\nHow do I respond?\n\nWhat if my son stares with a face like my own\nAnd says he wants to be like me when he's grown\nDamn, but I ain't finished growin'\nAnother night the inevitable prolongs\n\nAnother day, another dawn\nJust tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'\nAnother lie that I carry on\nI need to get back to the place I belong\n\n[Skylar]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming\n\n[Diddy]\n\"A house Is Not A Home\", I hate this song\nIs a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?\nAnd people got the nerve to blame you for it\nAnd you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it\n\nBut you felt it and still feel it\nAnd money can't make up for it or conceal it\nBut you deal with it and you keep ballin'\nPour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'\n\nBaby, we've been living in sin cause we've been really in love\nBut we've been living as friends\nSo you've been a guest in your own home\nIt's time to make your house your own, pick up your phone, come on\n\n[Skylar]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming\n\n[Diddy]\n\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\", I love that song\nWhenever it comes on it makes me feel strong\nI thought I told y'all that we won't stop\n'Til back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks\n\nIt's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy\nDrove me away than embraced me, forgave me\nFor all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming\nYeah it's been a long time coming\n\nLot of fights, lot of scars\nLot of bottles, lot of cars\nLot of ups, lot of downs\nMade it back, lost my dog\n(I miss you Big)\n\nAnd here I stand, a better man\n(A better man)\nThank you Lord\n(Thank you Lord)\n\n[Skylar]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming"}
